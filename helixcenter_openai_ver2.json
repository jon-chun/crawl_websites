How do we decide to take action in the midst of fear for our own lives–go to war, fight an intruder, save a person falling on subway tracks–or to ward off catastrophes such as global climate change and the irreversible loss of species that could lead to the extinction of our own species? This roundtable will focus on the role of fear in the valuation of life, and on how we respond to rare but extreme risk. Catastrophic circumstances inspire extreme fear, and this alters cognitive processes and behaviors deemed rational choices under more ordinary circumstances. Studying human responses to fear can broaden our very understanding of what constitutes rational choice. A branch of mathematics called Topology holds the trump card: it leads to new ways to understand rationality in a larger context to include ambiguity and apparent contradictions that emerge in all logical systems—a universal law that was discovered by Kurt Gödel last century and analyzed by Bertrand Russell. The roundtable discussion will bring to bear economic, neuroscientific, psychological, and other perspectives on fear, and topology as a geometric tool to help us visualize and update the concept of rationality and make it appropriate for our complex, ever changing, and challenging world.

Her remarkable gifts have been described in a variety of ways, but one gift repeatedly recognized by readers is her skill at recounting the results of her capacity for observation. As Randall Jarrell remarked in response to her very first book of poems, North & South: “All her poems have written underneath, ‘I have seen it.’” Perhaps the following precise and general praise by Howard Moss successfully suggests her specialness: “What Elizabeth Bishop brings to poetry is a new imagination; because of that, she is revolutionary, not ‘experimental.’ … Admired by critics, poets, and anyone genuinely interested in writing, her work is not easily labeled…. She is not academic, beat, cooked, raw, formal, informal, metrical, syllabic, or what have you.

It might rest exclusively within the context of the work itself; or refer to the extra-musical world of concepts, actions, emotional states, and character; or stem from an intellectual perception of the formalist qualities of the work; or find its foundations in an emotional response to musical relationships. How might we define the aesthetic effects of music? What is it about this auditory experience that offers a unique connection to emotion, whether evanescent or enduring? Is the emotional experience of music particular to the listener, or might there be a universal quality to the way we respond to music?

G. Jung The concept of synchronicity was developed by the Nobel Laureate quantum physicist, Wolfgang Pauli and the Swiss psychiatrist C. Jung in the middle of the twentieth century. It stressed the empirical fact of meaningful coincidence—a special sense of coincidence of two or more causally unrelated events which have the same or similar meaning. Synchronistic phenomena cannot in principle be associated with conceptions of causality, and thus the interconnection of meaningful coincident factors must be thought of as acausal. While such occurrences are improbable from the perspective of causality, they are not infrequent. How may such phenomena be noted and approached today? Both physics and psychology explore mind on a continuum with matter, and so operate at the conjunctions of the mental and material. As an emergent meeting in the No-Time of fundamental physics and the tensed Time of daily life, synchronicity moves toward meaning at intersections of the objective and subjective, met both in our experimental sciences and in our felt registers of experience.",

How much sexism remains in the scientific profession? How much of it is borne by men? By women? What challenges have those women who have achieved success in the sciences faced?

In her 1978 book,Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag threw down the gauntlet in her denunciation of metaphor applied to illness, as leading to a false connection between psychological traits and disease, scorning the contemporaneous, popular notion of a “cancer personality,” that “[p]assion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses.” The advent of cellular, molecular and systems biology and genetics has profoundly altered our understanding of the biology of cancer. Such advances in knowledge help dispel fear and attenuate false metaphors; ironically, now over 35 years since Sontag’s treatise, the field of psychoneuroimmunology is revealing a truer picture of the influence of mind on cancer and the body’s immunity. What is the latest understanding of the biology of cancer? What role, if any, does the mind have on the development and course of cancer?

    "description": "This program, co-sponsored by The Jungian Psychoanalytic Association and The Helix Center is free and open to the public.  Pre-registration is required. For more information, consult the JPA websitewww.nyjung.orgor contact Allison Tuzo atJPA@nyjung.org How are mind and matter related? In the mid-20th century, the psychiatrist and analyst Carl Gustav Jung and the Nobel Laureate physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated the concept of synchronicity. They sought a philosophical answer to this still unsolved question of how the mental and material, the physical and psychological are related in time. Pauli and Jung’s thesis suggests two types of mind-matter correlations for synchronistic experiences in which meaning is crucial and pivotal. In this second roundtable on The Pauli-Jung Conjecture,” moderated by Beverley Zabriskie, Harald Atmanspacher and Joseph Cambray will further the April 2014 discussion at the Helix Center (video at www.helixcenter.org/videos/#/03Nq6MCh5Rc ). Edgar Choueiri and Farzad Mahootian will argue its central thesis, that the mental and the material are two complementary and intersecting aspects of one underlying reality.Atmanspacher will outline the speculations emerging from the conjecture’s “dual-aspect monism.” Using mental health care data, he will describe relevant psychophysical experiences from clinical settings. Cambray will discuss the significance of Atmanspacher’s research for a re-visioning of contemporary analysis and psychotherapy. Mahootian engages complementarity as an organizing principle in physical and social contexts, specifically in research laboratory settings. Choueiri, whose work focuses on space plasma physics and space exploration, will bring to bear questions which arise from applied science: the potential epiphanic role the theory of synchronicity can play, and the possible degeneration into the apophenia dreaded in experimental physics.",

How do novel entities arise from self-organizing complex systems? If a system itself shows adaptive, self-organizing properties not attributable to its aggregate micro-potentialities—such that at each new level of complexity, new properties arise—can science ever be confidently predictive? What are the implications of the complexity of science for our understanding of the brain/mind, other biological systems, and the social and behavioral sphere—from global economics to political philosophy?",

    "description": "Prior to the eighteenth century, and before Edmund Burke’s foundational treatise, the sublime was understood as beauty and greatness beyond measure. Subsequently, awe, the emotion classically associated with the sublime, was given new psychological depth and even physiological dimensions, bringing fear and the grotesque into aesthetic considerations of the sublime. In Kantian aesthetics, the sublime exists beyond the realm of the sensible: beyond form and purpose, but not beyond morality. How might the nature of the sublime differ in relation to visual arts, music, religious experience, nature itself? What can religion and philosophy, as well as psychology and neuroscience, teach us about the distinction between an experience of pleasure and the ecstasy of the sublime?",

Student Fees: $50 before March 15. $75 from March 16.Registration and Payment via Eventbrite. Exploring the differences in his temperament from two other pioneers of depth psychology, Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, the Swiss psychiatrist C. G. Jung developed his personality types theory as a flexible, four-function two-attitude model of introversion and extraversion. The basis for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, it is still widely used for assessing individual type orientation. The MBTI is prominent in couples and family therapy, vocational counseling, coaching, and organizational development. In psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, psychological types assessment is a key to interpreting dream figures, recognizing complexes, integrating projections, and the dynamics of transference and counter-transference.

What is it about this dynamic principle of displacement, exchange, and creative renewal that also links it to the exercise of political power and the possession of linguistic/literary capital? Why do some still consider it a necessary evil, while others regard it as a testimony to the rich diversity of human expression? Because its processes are so pervasive a feature of thought and experience, we must ask, on the one hand, does anything escape translation? And on the other hand, we must also ask, is everything (ultimately) translatable?  Translation Studies as a field has grown tremendously in the last two decades. This event will focus on translation as a psychic, aesthetic, and cultural phenomenon. We are extremely fortunate to have with us a group of celebrated literary translators and theorists of translation, who work in different languages and across genres and periods.

The distinguished members of the Comité and the Freud Fund are thus most pleased to inaugurate a series of international conferences in dialogue with American peers, through the joint sponsorship of the Helix Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. Professors in the humanities and social sciences, psychoanalysts, and cultural and political personages will hold roundtable discussions on three themes: The ordinary, psycho-physiological preconditions of identity formation, which characteristically belong to a closed system (whether familial, national, linguistic, or religious), are, in effect, all encompassing and exclusionary.  Freud’s teachings on the psychology of the masses – usually far removed from educational programs – are required  to make a clear distinction between the homeland (patrie,the open political system decided by the will of the citizens) and thenation(a closed, blood-related system embodying a will ascribed to a hypothetical ancestral founder). The latter definition is even more applicable to religious communities, accounting for the possible integration of civil and religious powers. Freud held that education was one of the impossible professions, along with government and psychoanalysis. The growing secularization of the individual world leads to the belief that one can expect more gratification from an organic connection to the environment than from spiritual and communal connections. If that is the case, what is there to teach other than technological pragmatism, that is to say, tools adapted to mere organismic life, and the idea of “every man for himself”? The voice of God-as-Savior, which was heretofore hoped for and beloved, has no more currency in our world, now obscured or extinguished by the din of the music and the messages blaring continuously through our headphones. The voice of the teacher is lost, stifled by that of entertainment. If, as Hegel put forth, the primary desire of man is not to satisfy basic needs, but rather to be recognized, then his last recourse – which was once the guiding voice of God – is the desire to know. Perhaps we are now tasked with facilitating access to, or rather, midwifing the rebirth – since it was present at our Hellenic origins – of something akin to the ruckus of the gods. In a context of globalizing consumerism, the cultural uniformity of lifestyles and behaviors may provoke an exacerbation of identity problems, an autarchic withdrawal, the selling out of law, and manifold social violence. Such phenomena are found almost everywhere, in conjunction with an unprecedented and unrelenting economic and social crisis, tied to resurfacing nationalism and populism, and to the brutal expression of religious fundamentalism. The world’s democracies are in jeopardy. Nationalism feeds off of a double illusion: the ego-ideal joins with the momentum of the crowds led by lawless leaders, and with a view towards satisfying uninhibited drives (desires) without exterior constraint. As a consequence, the fringes of the population are further marginalized and are ready to “withdraw from reality.” In the face of this malaise, the political response is muffled by the noises and resentments of the masses. “Whenever I have expressed feelings of national exaltation,” wrote Freud, “I have tried to suppress them as disastrous and unfair.” He wrote elsewhere, “Fools, visionaries, sufferers from delusions, neurotics and lunatics have played great roles at all times in the history of mankind and not merely when the accident of birth had bequeathed them sovereignty. Usually they have wreaked havoc; but not always.” Freudian knowledge represents a return to reason, against the downward slide of identity crisis, religious and nationalist extremism; it gives meaning to humanism and cosmopolitanism.",

Is one’s contentedness with one’s life the sole measure of a life going well? Is the pleasure one gets good or is one’s getting it the thing that makes it good (in other words, is it good for oneself because it seems good to oneself)? How does one’s happiness comport with the welfare of others? Are some pleasures more valuable than others? Is happiness necessary for a good life? The above questions are a mere sampling of the many ways our roundtable will explore the meaning of happiness and the profound epistemological questions of ethics it evokes, as well as consider the role of positive psychology in raising awareness and provoking controversies regarding the ways we define and measure happiness and thence shape socioeconomic theories and policies.",

So, as proposed by Grady Booch, let’s imagine unleashing a technology platform using natural language processing and machine learning, such as IBM’s Watson, in the physical world. Give it eyes, ears, and touch, then let it act in that world with hands and feet and a face, not just as an action of force but also as an action of influence. This is embodied cognition: by placing the cognitive power of such a platform in a robot, in an avatar, an object in your hand, or even in the walls of an operating room, conference room, or spacecraft, we take a Watson’s ability to understand and reason and draw it closer to the natural ways in which humans live and work. In so doing, we augment individual human senses and abilities, giving that technology platform the ability see a patient’s complete medical condition, feel the flow of a supply chain, or drive a factory like a maestro before an orchestra.",

    "description": "A nomenclator was a slave whose duty was to accompanying his master in canvassing the streets of Classical Rome in order to recall the names of those his master encountered. Each of us is, in a way, both that ancient politician and that slave, relying on others’ memories to supply us with knowledge, and others relying on us for the knowledge we recall for them. Hence, knowledge has always been, in part, a distributive entity, requiring a delegation of mental tasks, an implicit commitment to a social contract. Histories have documented the occurrence of mass delusions—which also leads us to question our collective intuition. Close to the origins of humankind is a fascination with the unknown and the unverifiable, with the early cultivation of spiritual life and religion proving as a testament to this. What is apocryphal and what should believe in? Even to the present day, as technology and science become evermore complicated, we are asked to distinguish between proven fact and educated speculation. In the age of a seemingly omniscient internet, an impersonal cloud-mind (with which—despite attempts to humanize Siri and “her” ilk—no one can yet lay claim outside of fiction to a convincing reciprocal emotional relationship), when the object of our confided ignorance is no longer a person but a thing, when our subjective sense of self is no longer limned by the encounter with another, what happens to our ability to distinguish internal from external knowledge? Are we led to an illusory sense of our own knowledge? Is the immediate, distributive information of the internet changing the way our brains work, possibly holding the promise of transcending the limitations of individual knowledge? If so, does the virtue of its collective knowledge lead us further to question the very value of our individuality? Or are we heedlessly (or ineluctably) heading toward a human-machine collective heretofore only within the purview of science fiction? There is great excitement in the scientific community about the prospect of forming a transitive partnership with a seemingly unlimited source of knowledge. Where, however, is the place of wisdom? Does more information, more knowledge, inevitably lead to superior opinions, decision-making, and moral understanding? Is collective knowledge always less susceptible to the pretense of knowledge that individual thinking is? The history of human advancement would suggest otherwise, replete as it is with counterexamples to the superiority of collective knowledge over individual reasoning",

    "description": "The American poet Ezra Pound proclaimed that “Poetry is news that stays news!” On a different note, his contemporary William Carlos Williams said that “It is difficult / to get the news from poems / yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of what is found there.” Do modernist maxims such as these also define the ever-expanding range and diversity of poetry today? Which poets are doing interesting or important work? Who are the earlier poets that inspired them? And what is the nature, role, appeal and significance of contemporary poetry? When it comes to grasping experiences and communicating their meaning, what does this art form provide that fiction, journalism, academic writing, film, and other genres do not? Indeed, in this age of sociopolitical turmoil, Internet overload, media saturation, and often chaotic or reductive thinking, in what sense does poetry offer deeper, more gratifying kinds of engagement? In response to questions such as these, a roundtable of diverse and accomplished poets will discuss what is going on in the poetry world today. They will explore the allure and value of contemporary poetry through different lenses—conceptual, musical, visual, literary, sociopolitical, and psychological. (The second part of the program will consist of a lively Q & A.) This event will be curated by Anne-Marie Levine, Chair of the Arts and Humanities Committee at the Helix Center for Interdiscipliary Investigation.",

    "description": "We have every reason to believe that different disciplines and dedications have much to gain from each other. Imhotep, one of the earliest polymaths, was a physician, astronomer, and an engineer—but, as an architect, he also had a gift for design, and as a poet, a penchant for the art of writing. Far away, millennia later, Zhang Heng became noted in the histories of the Han Dynasty as an early scientist and scholar, although this was not at any expense for talent of art, as his contemporary wrote that “the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods.” Likewise, from the works of Da Vinci and Hildegard de Bingen, to geniuses of our time, the bond between the sciences and art is observed across the world and throughout the ages. This is not just true within individuals or a phenomenon seen in great thinkers alone. Our quotidian experience tells us so, abundant with the evidence of each field’s dependence on, and advancement of, the other: from the drawing of star maps and anatomical sketches to the math and physics of optics and perspective, to the latest technological advances in computer design. Two cultures converge as we discuss the significance of art and science in this three day series. Tickets now on sale.Click here to purchase at EventBrite.

    "description": "Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould’s drawings of Darwin’s finches to the success story of Steve Jobs’ Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences. What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in? How does this work get funded? How can we ensure collaboration is not just a buzzword? Who owns a collaboration? Can art influence science as science influences art, and should it? What does the future of collaboration look like?

    "description": "STEAM – orScienceTechnologyEngineeringArtMathematics – is the hot topic educational movement sweeping our nation and the world. Growing out of the emphasis to get more students in STEM subjects to remain a scientific and technologically advanced nation, STEAM was born in 2008, and advocates for the integration of arts and design learning in STEM. STEAM aims to foster well-rounded thinking, boost creativity in all fields, and encourages cross-disciplinary exchange to spark innovation by giving equal voice to the arts and sciences. This type of educational model not only breaks down disciplinary barriers, but allows students of all dispositions to engage in STEAM subjects from various points of view, where one can find science through art, or art through technology, or mathematics through design. As with any new movement, there is much uncharted territory in STEAM, and ample area for exploration, expansion, and revision of curricula. This roundtable topic will address the current state of STEAM and the future of education at large. How does one successfully teach STEAM, and what does a STEAM curriculum look like?

    "description": "Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould’s drawings of Darwin’s finches to the success story of Steve Jobs’ Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences. What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in? How does this work get funded? How can we ensure collaboration is not just a buzzword? Who owns a collaboration? Can art influence science as science influences art, and should it? What does the future of collaboration look like?

    "description": "STEAM – orScienceTechnologyEngineeringArtMathematics – is the hot topic educational movement sweeping our nation and the world. Growing out of the emphasis to get more students in STEM subjects to remain a scientific and technologically advanced nation, STEAM was born in 2008, and advocates for the integration of arts and design learning in STEM. STEAM aims to foster well-rounded thinking, boost creativity in all fields, and encourages cross-disciplinary exchange to spark innovation by giving equal voice to the arts and sciences. This type of educational model not only breaks down disciplinary barriers, but allows students of all dispositions to engage in STEAM subjects from various points of view, where one can find science through art, or art through technology, or mathematics through design. As with any new movement, there is much uncharted territory in STEAM, and ample area for exploration, expansion, and revision of curricula. This roundtable topic will address the current state of STEAM and the future of education at large. How does one successfully teach STEAM, and what does a STEAM curriculum look like? How do we enact STEAM in our existing educational system? What are the biggest challenges STEAM and new educational models? How do we form new educational models for transdisciplinary work?

Advocates also hold out the possibilities of radical life extension through rejuvenation technologies or alternately reincarnating individuals inside of computers. The proponents of transhumanism argue that the exponential growth in scientific knowledge and know-how is leading humanity to a “Singularity” sometime in the mid 21st century. In that Singularity, our technologies will cross a threshold. We will become post- or trans-humans.

The most current definition comes from John Eastwood in Toronto: Drawing from research across many areas of psychological science and neuroscience, Eastwood and colleagues define boredom as “an aversive state of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity,” which arises from failures in one of the brain’s attention networks. Interestingly, people who investigate boredom, find it thus: “Boredom is a blast! To a curious and creative scholar, nothing is ever too trivial.”(Maureen Corrigan re Patricia Meyer Spacks’ book of that name) And, “Peter Toohey “finds a perverse kind of glee in his subject.” (Daily Telegraph) Curiously the subject seems to ingivorate those who study it. We hope that this roundtable will, in bringing together scholars from literature, psychiatry, neurology, cultural history, and the law who have thought deeply about the subject, continue the exploration of the meaning and characteristics of boredom, and in so doing give the audience a chance to enlarge their own ideas.",

On the one hand, if one asserts that all of reality comes within the sweeping compass of a unified science, what, then, of the ontological and epistemological standing of the humanities? On the other hand, if not, does this rescue the humanities from the ascendancy of science, from the power of evidential, empirical veridicality, of a discipline founded on the phenomenal, over one founded on the noumenal?

    "description": "Creative Turbulence is an art exhibition that brings together art and science through a collaborative creative process in the form of four unique works of art. By pairing artists with scientists, we are challenging traditional notions of scientific perception, expanding the artists’ access to science, and engaging viewers in a new way of understanding science. The exhibition methodology is based on the underlying nature of experimentation shared by both scientists and artists. The scientific component of Creative Turbulence is based in physics–-working within the fields of fluid dynamics, turbulence, and complex systems. The artistic component of Creative Turbulence is based on existing artistic research and medium specific processes that relate to physics, through the process of making the work or as represented directly in the artistic output itself. Art ExhibitionViewing Hours:Saturday, June 9th, 2:00pm to 5:00 pmMonday, June 11th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmTuesday, June 12th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmWednesday, June 13th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmThursday, June 14th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmFriday, June 15th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmSaturday, June 16th, 12:00 pm to 4:00pm A variety of artworks will be on display, including: “Atmospheric Memory” (from artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer in collaboration with NYU Tandon School of Engineering researcher Enrico Fonda and Georgia Tech’s Devesh Ranjan) was inspired by Charles Babbage’s theory that spoken words have an everlasting impact on the universe. Lozano-Hemmer uses vegetable glycerin and glycol to capture the 3D form of air turbulence as it exists the mouth of a volunteer, then created a permanent 3D version of the breath. Lozano-Hemmer displayed another piece in the series at Art Basel in Miami in 2016. “Collective Motion” (from artist David McLeod in collaboration with NYU Tandon Professor of Mechanical Engineering Maurizio Porfiri) uses state-of-the-art animation software to visualize the behavior of interactive agents that organize themselves in a collective motion. The concept is related to flocking (as birds do) and schooling (as fish do) – and more broadly to non-equilibrium systems undergoing a phase transition. The structured behavior of these active particles bridges the gap between the motion of living things and the motion of inactive matter, such as in classical fluid dynamics. “Immutable Swell” (from artist and NYU Tandon Integrated Digital Media Lecturer Dana Karwas) is a sculptural representation of an ocean wave as it breaks onto land. She created the artwork by extracting over 500,000 data points from a custom buoy sensor placed in the waters of Cape Cod. This data was combined with her own personal experience of swimming in the ocean to emerge as a complex 3D digital inscription of an ocean wave. By using software and motion analysis to observe the wave from a digital distance, Karwas was able to distill invisible structures in the wave. “Immutable Swell” represents an opportunity for viewers to make a connection to the powerful turbulence and mysterious patterns found in the ocean. “Nimbus Atlas II” (from artist Berndnaut Smilde) consists of a series of high-definition videos depicting human-made clouds emerging and decomposing in a void. The footage was captured with a high-speed camera, resulting in a slow-motion visualization of how clouds evolve, change shape, and reflect light. (His “indoor clouds” were recognized by Time Magazine as among the “Top Ten Inventions of 2012.”) Also available for viewing is the work of physicist Daniel P. Lathrop, who pioneered visualization techniques that make it possible to observe the mysteries of quantum fluids – which exhibit quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level – with the naked eye. Lathrop collaborated with physicist and NYU Tandon Dean Katepalli R. Sreenivasan and used superfluid helium, which flows without friction and exists only near absolute zero. “The strong visual component of many of the investigations being done in fluid dynamics makes it easy to showcase the results to a lay audience in a compelling and immediate way,” said Fonda, who organized the exhibit and roundtable. “Fluids are a part of everyone’s daily life – from stirring coffee, taking a shower, and applying perfume to flying or driving in various conditions – so everyone has at least an intuitive feel for how fluids behave. I think people find it easier to relate to this work than to other topics in physics, which despite being fascinating are more abstract and seemingly less applicable to their lives.” The connection between art and turbulence came to public attention in 2004, when NASA released images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys that looked remarkably like the luminescent swirls depicted in Vincent van Gogh’s famous painting “Starry Night.” A multinational team of physicists subsequently explored the relationship between the turbulencevan Gogh depicted and the natural phenomenon of fluid turbulence and found a shockingly precise – and inexplicable – mathematical correlation that continues to confound scientists and art historians today.",

Our roundtable will bring together artists and scientists exploring what is considered the last unsolved problem of classical physics, turbulence, its experimental and technical visualizations, and its many theoretical and philosophical implications, including: the emergence of complex, self-organized structures from the chaos of turbulence; entropy; quantum fluid dynamics; and condensed matter. Roundtable Discussion: Thursday, June 14th, 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm Art Exhibition Viewing Hours:Saturday, June 9th, 2:00pm to 5:00pmMonday, June 11th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmTuesday, June 12th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmWednesday, June 13th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmThursday, June 14th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmFriday, June 15th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmSaturday, June 16th, 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm",

Some proofs, however, are so long or complex, or both, that they cannot be checked for errors by human experts.  In response, a small but growing community of mathematicians, collaborating with computer scientists, have designed systems that allow proofs to be verified by machine.  The success in certifying proofs of some prestigious theorems has led some mathematicians to propose a complete rethinking of the profession, requiring future proofs to be written in computer readable code.  A few mathematicians have gone so far as to predict that artificial intelligence will replace humans in mathematical research, as in so many other activities. One’s position on the possible future mechanization of proof is a function of one’s view of mathematics itself.  Is it a means to an end that can be achieved as well, or better, by a competent machine as by a human being?   If so, what is that end, and why are machines seen as more reliable than humans?  Or is mathematics rather an end in itself, a human practice that is pursued for its intrinsic value?   If so, what could that value be, and can it ever be shared with machines?",

Is there an analogous ’unifying anchor’ for Mathematics? Is Mathematics unified and does it make sense to talk of the beauty of mathematics? Mathematical language is one unifying force, and the subject is laced with analogies linking radically different intuitions, the classical example being algebra and geometry. More modern syntheses bring together a vast range of mathematical sensibilities, accomplishments, truths, and applications.

    "description": "“Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?” This familiar courtroom oath unpacks some of the subtleties of truth-telling. Making true statements is not all there is to it. What one says may be true, but what is omitted in the telling may present a false picture. And one may tell the truth, but that testimony may be distorted by the commingling of some untruths. True statements come embedded in a matrix of linked propositions whose truth value we often cannot personally vouch for: Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, Oswald killed Kennedy, and quarks come in six flavors are good examples of such claims. Many true beliefs are built upon claims we must take for granted as foundational, typically based on authority or on what those around us believe to be the case. A false statement, told willingly and with foreknowledge of its falsehood, is how we define lying. But we can be misled by a simple and straightforward claim – especially if we are motivated to believe it – when some of its many underlying claims are distorted or manipulated for the purpose of dissembling. When it comes to liars, the subtleties deepen. It is often said that “pathological liars” believe the lies they make up, and this is what contributes to their lying and their effectiveness as liars. We hear people ask: “Did Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos know she was lying or were her claims merely wishful thinking?” Of the many notions, large or small, expressed by liars, how many are directly contradictory to their firsthand awareness of the facts on the ground and how many based on flimsy premises only dimly considered or validated? How many of these premises are highlighted out of proportion to other known facts or elided entirely just to make their case? There are numerous psychological and neuropsychiatric studies of liars, confabulators, and sociopaths. Tales of fabulists – Baron Münchausen perhaps the most well-known – make for popular reading just because each liar is unique, and the vicissitudes of their wishes and dreams present a thrill-ride of impending disclosure. The variety of “tangled webs” give some indication of what makes these tales so fascinating. Our panel today will be analyzing these many facets to what liars do when they are lying.",

In response, a small but growing community of mathematicians, collaborating with computer scientists, have designed systems that allow proofs to be verified by machine. The success in certifying proofs of some prestigious theorems has led some mathematicians to propose a complete rethinking of the profession, requiring future proofs to be written in computer readable code. A few mathematicians have gone so far as to predict that artificial intelligence will replace humans in mathematical research, as in so many other activities. One’s position on the possible future mechanization of proof is a function of one’s view of mathematics itself. Is it a means to an end that can be achieved as well, or better, by a competent machine as by a human being? If so, what is that end, and why are machines seen as more reliable than humans? Or is mathematics rather an end in itself, a human practice that is pursued for its intrinsic value? If so, what could that value be, and can it ever be shared with machines?",

    "description": "The starting point of this roundtable discussion is Joseph LeDoux’s book,The Deep History of Ourselves: The Four-Billion-Year Story of How We Got Conscious Brains. LeDoux’s research on how the brain detects and responds to danger helped jumpstart and define the modern science of emotion. After three decades, he came to the realization that the commonly received conception of human emotions as evolutionarily pre-formed states of mind is wrong. InThe Deep History of Ourselves, he used the four-billion year story of life to explain why. His key insight was that single-cell microbes, the ancient ancestors of  modern day bacteria, had the same basic survival requirements we do—they had to detect danger, search for and incorporate nutrients, balance fluids and ions, and reproduce. When we do these things, we feel fear, hunger, thirst, and pleasure, and assume that these states underlie our behavior. But the purpose of these ancient processes has little direct relation to these psychological states, which came much later. Emotions, he concluded, result from our efforts to make sense of the significant moments in our lives. And to do this requires the precise kind of brain we have. Discussing these ideas with LeDoux will be experts from a range of scientific areas, including evolutionary biology (Niklas), the cognitive neuroscience of emotion (Lindquist), psychiatry (Hurowitz), and the philosophy of consciousness (Rosenthal).",

    "description": "Justice is blind, the saying goes, which means that a person’s particulars – their social status, race, gender, etc. – should have no bearing on fair judgement in any legal dispute. By this standard, we are all considered equal before the law. In A Theory of Justice, the philosopher John Rawls proposed the following thought experiment: what kind of society and government would you choose if you did not know beforehand the role you would play in that society? Imagining yourself an anonymous, “random” person — raceless, genderless, and classless — in other words “blinded” to your own particulars, what would you endorse as the fairest system for the distribution of assets, of opportunity and obligation for the citizenry?And now imagine Justice wearing Xray glasses! Artificial Intelligence has arrived, and by hoovering up personal data at an increasing rate, data we are often even unaware of “emitting” — the rhythm of daily movement and sleep, vocal patterns and word choice frequencies — we have begun to disclose information that in many instances exceeds what we know about ourselves. To the holders of this information we are the furthest thing from anonymous. Now consider how this utter loss of anonymity might ultimately impact how society distributes assets and opportunity, and how it dictates each individual’s obligation to the state.Machine learning and other AI algorithms are being used in a wide variety of contexts, including medical and legal decision-making, in addition to ad targeting, mortgage risk and sentencing recommendation systems, etc. The existing database already creates a cyber-profile for each of us at a level of resolution inconceivable just a decade ago. And then, of course, computers are inference engines, and these high-resolution profiles spit out predictions about our choices and behaviors that we have no role in vetting. Based on this “number crunching” we may be thrown into categories we did not even know existed, with important implications. And then there is the worry: will AI serve us in our best interest? The fictional HAL 9000 computer in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey was designed to serve mankind but ran dramatically afoul of this credo. Should we begin now to consider the rules of engagement between ourselves and the super-intelligent machine agents we may reasonably anticipate? As the use of AI algorithms grows more and more prevalent, it is important that we think hard about the ethical, legal, and social implications of these technologies and their myriad current and potential future uses.",

    "description": "Memory is not a dusty cellar, open treasure chest, or sealed pandora’s box. It is a dynamic process, a stream of renditions and reflections. It conveys to us not what strictly happened, but embeds us in a retained internal moment, in an external encounter, or an imprint from another’s story. Memory re-enforces, revises, re-edits, and re-interprets as we grapple with the present and look forward to the imminent and not so immediate future. Memory is paradoxical: privately phenomenological and yet irreducibly entwined in family or group, subjective yet sculpted by others’ reflections; reflected in one’s mirror yet refracted through the lens of a culture, religion, and history. Our memory may resonate with the memories of others, individual and collective, and become thereby fortified, annexed, or diluted. Implicit memories are subliminal, subconscious, often dormant in the body of an organism until awakened by association, affordance, and circumstance. Explicit memories, on the other hand, form the quilt-like narratives of ourselves. The past may magnify or muffle the presence of our current selves. And it can do both. Throughout life, we form and reform particular memories from a protean sort of raw material, from the freshly perceived and from the recycled and reverberated. Memory can embitter and it can bring wisdom. It can soothe, entertain, or distress and re-traumatize. Whether implicit or explicit, positive or negative, we fear the loss of memory, both the short and the long term, and experience it as a theft of personhood, a ghostly vanishing of the self amidst recognized others and familiar settings. Simple lapses of recall can be frightening for some, an omen of a coming loss of one’s being in the world. The neuroscientist Gerald Edelman described consciousness as “the remembered present”, a dynamic, emergent, and ongoing narrative by which we continue the search to find ourselves both in the universe of generations, and our singular lived lives.",

    "description": "Placebos “work” for quite a few medical problems. But how? And what is the work they do? What one thinks a medicine is capable of, one’s idea of that medicine, may affect us in the way “proper” medicines do. This implies that, in observing the work of a placebo we are watching an idea affect biology, the mind moving the body. Despite the dualist notions this description elicits, where mind and body are held as separate entities, most neuroscientists, generally of a monistic bent, welcome the challenge of the placebo effect. Most insist that placebos precisely demonstrate that the mind is one with the body. Yet, fabulous stories of placebo cures, both astounding and well-confirmed, produce the evidence but not yet a complete account linking belief to cure. By what mechanisms do our thoughts affect our health? Are placebos a special case of how ideas impact our physical selves; or rather, does this open a window into how all thinking works? The inverse of the placebo, the nocebo effect, produces rather than mitigates symptoms. Here an inert substance believed to be a “poison” can essentially poison us. More commonly, physicians worry about “suggestibility,” when, for example, a patient insists “if anyone will get that side-effect, it’ll be me.” At the same time, many patients refuse to consider that their “psychology” has anything to do with the symptoms they experience. But if we wish to move away from the notion that the nocebo effect is “all in one’s head,” what then is suggestibility? What accounts for the range of responses in the population to the placebo and nocebo effects?History chronicles the universal desire to stave off illness, to lesser or greater degrees a concern of all cultures. What we now refer to as the placebo effect evolved out of the mythical and magical practices of the shaman. But, with a modern belief system less conducive to shamanism, the “inert” placebo is often viewed as deceptive. Might we yet arrive at an ethical reliance on placebo treatment, both to determine and then harness their evident value in promoting emotional and physical health?",

Of late our culture has grown more attuned to the semiotics of stress, as it expresses itself in our brains and guts, our minds and bodies, our spirit and imagination. When it derives from a goal achieved, it may serve as fuel. But, with a pain inflicted, when choice is not possible, when we are the object rather the subject, stress corrosively imprints identity and erodes our resilience and potential for realization. Current research reveals the severe effects of stress on the brain. It halts development, hinders plasticity, and entangles and ensnares the inner workings of our cells. Stress is tantamount to aging, and in excess it hastens the aging of our bodies and minds. At the level of society, persecution and bullying, neglect and injustice, scarcity and want, all inflict both individual and collective stress. As a response to its presence, as individuals we move our bodies, amuse our minds, contain our impulses in meditation, create and enjoy music and art, arrange social engagements, and seek the sublime muse that Nature can be. We strive to redress sources of communal stress – through activism, a commitment to justice, and the lifting of noisome prejudices. We invite you to relieve yourself of weekend stress by joining inspiring researchers and seekers as they describe the problems and seek solutions to stress.",

It was held that the widowed queen of an Egyptian pharaoh could pull his posthumous sperm into her womb to create a child. The Olympian god Zeus could procreate in all sorts of ways, including swooping down as a shower of gold into a young womb. His daughter Athena sprang full-born from his head; his son Dionysus from his thigh. And it was the wind of the Holy Ghost that inseminated a certain young virgin. Inevitably, technologies entered the process of conception and pregnancy bringing with them a growing set of choices regarding gender and other attributes of offspring. The wish for greater certainty and enhanced selectivity have now entered many phases and aspects of generation. Sperm, eggs, and genes may be shared, selected, bought and sold. Polygenic screening of gene variants in embryos mandates additional consciousness, choices, and unavoidable ethical puzzles.

    "description": "The Dismal Science seems to analyze and involve most aspects of our lives.  While traditional macroeconomics continues to concern itself with  natural rates of inflation and unemployment, with tariffs and taxes, with supply and demand, at both the meso- and micro-levels, economics has productively linked with sociology, social history, anthropology, and psychology. The field of behavioral economics , having adopted the methodology of experimental psychology, is now a full-fledged subgenre within the field. Many of its fascinating and useful insights have in turn seeded new lines of investigation in these sister disciplines. Now, less out of sheer academic exuberance and more by brute necessity, economics is applying its methods to recent natural and man-made disasters of global consequence. The triad of climate change, the mass migration of refugees, and the pandemic-driven disruptions of the supply chain has descended  with alarming impact. In response, economics examines the movement of peoples and things amidst these disruptive forces, assaying their ramifications from both a birds eye view and up close. The effects on inflation, unemployment, family structure, healthcare, education, poverty and productivity are varied and profound. Our roundtable will look at the current dynamics of economics , and ask where the field may move in the 21stcentury.

    "description": "Neuroplasticity: it’s what our brains do. We alter our minds when we engage with the world and with the people in it. But, of course, when we think of “mind altering drugs” we refer to something else. That there might be a shortcut, a wormhole, a portal to some new and improved state of mind has long held our fascination. Yes, that includes alcohol, but while alcohol can affect mood and anxiety and augment sociability, there is something especially appealing about opening a window onto a whole new view of reality itself. Hence the new question born in the 1960’s: “are you experienced?’. Psychedelics have been featured and feared, romanticized and reviled, lauded and suspected since the earliest epochs of human history. In many tribal ceremonies certain substances with “mind expanding” properties were invoked as communal invitations toward the transcendent. In battle, various plants, herbs, and potions were reputed to make warriors assassins, berserkers, or heroes. From Greek roots meaning “mind manifesting,” psychedelic refers to a range of mind, mood, and consciousness altering effects – cognitive, perceptual, emotional, and behavioral – deriving from a varied array of compounds. Following the 60’s “turn on, tune in, drop out” popularity of recreational psychedelics, by the early 1970’s it was the risks associated with psychedelics that gained a hold on popular opinion and on the research community. Times are a changing. With renewed interest, medical research is now exploring psychedelics for the treatment of mental illness, pain management and mental soothing in terminal states. With care given to providing a safe physical space and emotional support throughout, psychedelics can create feelings of union and of breaking free from time and space, often accompanied by visual hallucinations, illusions, and synesthesia. But, in “micro-doses,” doses too low to bring on a “trip,” hallucinogens are now being studied and in some instances found to ameliorate the suffering of PTSD patients, to treat obsessive-compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia nervosa, headache, and substance abuse. Medical alchemists believed their mixtures could act as poison or panacea. From communal traditions and now clinical research, hope is emerging that there is something in psychedelics that can help to sooth suffering souls and provide safe and effective treatment of some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "description": "Physics being the study of the fundamental properties of Nature, as the name implies, metaphysics investigates the nature of Nature, the what-must-therefore-be-the-case of those discoverable physical properties. For centuries, either explicitly or implicitly, metaphysics created the background and organizing principles for scientific research. But as the 20th century progressed there arose a number of challenges to this position. The epistemic turn laid down by the quantum theory’s Copenhagen interpretation places our knowledge about Nature, in the sense of what we can know about it, above what it is “in itself.” Nearly contemporaneously, the famous “linguistic turn” heralded by the works of Wittgenstein and the ordinary language philosophers, urged “remaining quiet” about Nature beyond the acknowledged limits of what can be said about it. And more recently, on the heels of what has been referred to as the cognitive turn in psychology, philosophers like Richard Rorty focus on the modes of cognition and what to make of them (pragmatism redux) while the notion of Nature in itself is let go of. Today, in response to these skeptical trends, we see a revival of metaphysics, only now with a refined appreciation of how our empirical access to it relates to how Nature presents itself. The notion of an “experimental metaphysics” is no longer considered oxymoronic: some empirical research in quantum physics now offers up evidence in favor of one metaphysical view over another. Meanwhile, within perceptual neuroscience, the analysis of ambiguous stimuli is beginning to inform notions of what consciousness qua natural phenomenon could mean for the nature of Nature itself. This roundtable will scrutinize the ways in which we engage with Nature, and how the divergence of perspectives that result, some apparently strongly paradoxical, may yet be reconciled by a metaphysics that is always seeking to rise to this challenge.",

    "time": "",
    "description": "From the level of DNA to that of phenotype, life may be viewed as an articulation of code. Within such a model, phenotypes are a kind of abstraction of the DNA code. Starting with the genome, the DNA winds its way through RNA, proteins, and cellular process outward into the world beyond, and in the process it expresses an abstracted projection of itself onto the “plane” of the phenotype situated in its niche. There is one phenotype, our own, that has evolved to where it can design its own generative code. Among the many codes creating our human world is the digital, the binary lingua franca of software engineers. Written at one level as a linear script of ones and zeroes, and then expressed as other media and phenomena, coding underwrites the videos we engage with, the online menus from which we order, the diagnoses radiologists make, the security we crave, and the bombs we drop. Code serves to translate phenomena into a language distinct from the phenomena themselves: atoms, proteins, facial expressions, and the songs we love become symbols, numbers, or other grammars. This conversion is useful; it provides a way to communicate, utilize, predict, understand, and simulate phenomena. Scientific progress is impossible without a positivist kind of code, whereby a model of the world is generated through encoding phenomena into facts, mechanisms, systems, and laws that cohere logically. How do we understand an atom, for example without the scientific language encoding it? The language of the Anthropocene is code. It is coding that mints and maintains cryptocurrency and it is the language of the lightspeed communication driving financial transactions occurring every millisecond of every day. We speak to one another through encoded devices; we learn and work through screens that reconstitute our bodies and voices through the transmission of code. We play video games that are sophisticated assemblages of code, and we interact with folks online using coded exchanges. An entire meta-world is being constructed from code alone. As code comes to mediate so much of our lived experience, we face some important questions: how is our immersion in the encoded world affecting our lives? Might something vital, something unencoded or unencodable, get lost in translation? Like all abstractions, code will leave information out. Even the most sophisticated bit of code is invariably inadequate to capture the rich complexity of embodied, unmediated engagement. And what are we to make of miscommunication, misinformation, and deception by design? Code, after all, is also the language of espionage, deception, and surveillance. This conference intends to examine the various ways the digitalization of life and the growing metaverse may be separating us from an original, direct, and less abstracted form of life.

Meanwhile, half of the population seems to feel the other half is deluded.

New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently suggested “The world is too scary. Politics is too creepy,” and “horror is too real,” while David Brooks wrote of “The rising tide of global sadness.” Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter surely engenders further unease about how an unelected few can control how we live and what we may know.

Each of these four strands has a rich (and ongoing) philosophical history. Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Bahktin, Vygotsky and others have drawn attention to the role of action and interaction in (in)forming our experience.  What do our bodies contribute to qualia, to the phenomenology that seems to mark consciousness for us? How does our embeddedness in a social world with others impact our sense of reality? And what role is played by our constant manipulation of things and interaction with others in anchoring us, not simply the way gravity keeps our feet on the ground, but as a woven fabric creates a world we can inhabit and experience together? Psychosis provides a test case for theories proposed by advocates of 4E Cognition. But, of course, it does as well for other neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers and AI researchers. How is that sense of a shared world disrupted in individuals diagnosed with this condition? How disrupted must it be and in what ways, for a diagnosis to be apposite? Meanwhile, how “shared” is the world, and what does a more or less shared world mean for the ideas, and their expression, that may be found in it?

Throughout the history of philosophy and increasingly in neurological studies, these questions have been central to our understanding of human experience. This panel seeks to address these questions by thinking of memory as a process that occurs both in and outside the brain – in which tools and infrastructures, along with social and personal experiences create the conditions for what we believe we remember. It is this extended sense of mnemonic experience that allows us to look back and think ahead. This panel will also discuss how our increasing engagement with moderntechnē(which originally meant both art and technology) can help to define, clarify, and enhance our memories, even as the digital world threatens to overwhelm our attention and corporations offer to index our every memory.

Starting in 1995, astronomers have discovered exoplanets: planets orbiting other stars. Over 5300 have been confirmed, and it’s likely there are more planets than stars in the universe. There are ten billion habitable worlds in our galaxy, all of which have the raw material for biology. The stage is set for the first detection of life beyond Earth. It might come within the Solar System, but the suitable space missions are technically challenging, expensive, and take more than a decade to plan and deliver to their destinations. It’s more likely that microbial life will be detected by its alteration of an exoplanet atmosphere. The James Webb Space Telescope and several upcoming telescopes in space and on the ground can make this type of observation. It’s also possible that more advanced forms of intelligent life will be found through evidence of their technology. A panel of expert astrobiologists will discuss various strategies for detecting life beyond Earth, and debate which is most likely to succeed and when. Proof that biology is not unique to this planet would be one of the most profound events in the history of science.",

Shakespeare’s works remain as compelling as ever, and they are being envisioned in both traditional and often astonishingly new ways. In Boston, Chicago, Idaho, Kentucky, Lake Tahoe, Oregon, New York City and beyond, regional companies are gearing up for their annual sell-out summer Shakespeare festivals. The books and articles keep coming, and there is no end, it seems, to the new and different ways in which the Bard can be perceived: “All of Shakespeare’s Plays Are About Race,” declared a recent article inThe Atlantic.

    "description": "What is human life without emotion? Could the “dawn of humankind” even be imagined without emotion exerting its effects right there from the start? And across the millennia emotion has forever been at the heart of most matters. Human history has been shaped by emotion and reshaped by attitudes toward emotion; a powerful human force philosophers and theologians confront and reckon with again and again throughout history and in every culture. So near and so familiar to us all and yet emotions present all sorts of philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific paradoxes. Many of the same mysteries elicited by the study of consciousness generally seem to re-emerge even after zooming our focus in on emotion. Are the neural signatures of an emotion the same as the experience of that emotion? Do feelings contribute to our evolutionary fitness or are they by-products, epiphenomena that somehow follow from some more fundamental form of adaptation? How can we ever know what it’s like tofeellike a bat? Is that rat laughing at me? Why do emotions seem to control us at times, control our thoughts and behavior, while at other times we apparently have control over them? Listening to music, sipping some tea, calling a close friend: all of these activities are a means to sculpt our state of mind. When do they work and why do they sometimes fail so miserably? Do the emotions form a natural class? Cellos and oboes are both classified as instruments despite their obvious differences, and yet consider this: each can play the same melody. What features and what functions do the emotions share in common? This question is raised now especially as there is talk of incorporating empathy into artificial intelligence programming. Can sadness, anger, frustration, jealousy and joy be programmed? Should they be? Are they simply different component modules of general intelligence or do the emotions grow organically out of some other feature of experience that we don’t yet understand?",

Impermanence of mathematical concepts is the rule rather than the exception.  The progress of mathematics is punctuated by revolutions, in ways similar to the evolution of  art and science  Fundamental notions can change even in the space of a single generation, and disarray and controversy may follow.  Given that something so basic as the number 5 is subject to such instability, how can we still claim that mathematics is about absolute truth?  We will discuss various revolutions in mathematical concepts, from non-Euclidean geometry to imaginary numbers to some more intuition-defying contemporary developments.",

    "description": "“Now the touch only is common to all animals.”  Agrippa The very notion of sentience, with its root infeeling, cannot be understood without some reference to sensation. And sensation itself has at its bare core a “something” we feel. The response to that feeling is the mark of life: “quickening” upon touch is how we distinguish the animate from the inanimate. Touch demands physical contact. That breeze is the invisible dance of molecules on your face. Warmth is the agitation of your own particulate self, while coolness is the dissipation of that same agitation into the surround. While the scientific termmechanicalrefers to a physical force that contacts and thereby moves things, in the case of organisms, mechanical force incites a sensation on contact with that boundary, the skin. And whereas otherwise we say every action has an equal and opposite reaction, at that interface with the living some neuro-electrochemical reaction occurs. We understand that this new electrochemical medium somehow accounts for our inner feeling and that outer feeling of presence. The movement from sensation to perception is where talk of consciousness begins: where sensations “touch” our inner selves and form an experience we can engage and report on. This is our qualia. Citing Duchamp’s concept of theinfra-thin,Marjorie Perloff depicts that interface where sensation arises. The infra-thin partakes both sides of that interface and the interface along with it: this is the space toward which poetry directs us.",

Whatdoesaccount for taste? And from there: what role does discernment play in judgment? Beyond touch, the interface here – our tongue – dense in receptor sites, transcribes chemical as well as mechanical signals into electrochemical reactions. The feel of food and the flavor of food combine to form the sense of taste. And while taste may have evolved as a means to solve the problem of hunger, taste clearly is no longer limited to its role in satiety. This dissociation of hunger and taste presents itself both as a problem (formerlygluttony) and as a refined pleasure that forms its own category of art.

What is that wonderful aroma and how can I get to it?  Eww! What is that and how do I move away? More a path-wise world than a Newtonian one, the space of olfaction is about orienting the animal toward what is meaningful in its environment. Smell creates an ambiance, an affective and drive-related milieu, and it also strongly evokes memories of such settings. We have learned that body odor elicit feelings of personal attraction and repulsion.

    "description": "Vibration sense is one component of touch. Refinements of this sense, and in some animals theemissionof vibration – typically from the vocal cords – has evolved to echolocation, to clicks, grunts, roars and to speech. The vibration of one special membrane, the ear drum, creates that wonderful interface that enables us to appreciate and locate sounds in 3-dimensional space and to discern what the source of that sound is. Through that tiny interface a realm both wide and deep opens up. Through naturally occurring sounds, but especially through music, our emotions can be strongly influenced and even molded. Leonard Bernstein described music as a sonic sculpture whose parade-like evanescence incorporates rhythm, intensity, tone, and coloration. Time and timing enter into this experience, and that fourth dimension moves us closer to Newtonian space, as a sense of depth and of movement emerge and are refined. What is a soundscape if not a colorful space of emotion. Literally calling out (or warning off) the value-scape that is our world.",

    "description": "“The Aleph was probably two to three centimeters in diameter, but universal space was contained inside it . . .”  – JL Borges Our eyes move. They rove and they direct attention. Indeed, vision and our ability to focus attention more generally are intimately intertwined. And this hybrid faculty of vision/attention has been extended as a metaphor for the way we focus our attention to the contents of our minds, even when vision is not active. Of course, for many animals vision is not the most important sense. And this simple fact raises so many interesting puzzles concerning animal consciousness and the senses in general. How is our apperception of a world related to the senses through which we perceive it? How different is experience for those of us without vision, either inborn or lost? How might attention “work” differently when the other senses must take the lead? For most of us visionsynthesizesthe four other senses and provides the glue that vouches for our assertions of truth and claims of falsehood. What makes“the fox jumped over the fence”true, or false, for us?Eyewitnessandcertaintyare two concepts so closely related. Vision naturally figures in the creation and recording of images, and then too, of written language and its development.

    "description": "Panpsychism is the lightly subscribed philosophical position that consciousness is a property of all matter, large and small, simple and complex, alive and inert. According to panpsychism mind is everywhere. Eliminativism is the view that consciousness, at least what most of us consider our mind’s eye access to reality(phenomenal consciousness), exists quite literally nowhere, not even in our brains. According to this view, consciousness and its associated qualia are illusions. Between panpsychism and eliminativism there are quite a few alternative accounts of what consciousness is, but most adhere to the notion that it is demonstrably localizable and that its location is in the brain. The brain receives information inbound from Nature, which it represents and then responds to by predicting, constantly updating and predicting, how things in the world go. This general approach to consciousness is currently how most investigators in the field of consciousness studies are oriented, with several competing theories all falling within this framework. A relatively recent addition to this collection of metaphysical/scientific positions is the view that our minds grow and exist as a dynamic amalgam of the world, our bodies, and our brains; that it extends from our bodies out into the world; that our perceptions of an “out there” do not simplyrepresentthat space but are in fact, in part,out therein space. This approach has evolved into what is now known as 4E Cognition. The four E’s stand forextended,embedded,embodied, andenacted. While pulling up short of panpsychism, it pushes out and away from the purely brain-centered view of consciousness. This Roundtable intends to look into the debate about the where and wherefore of consciousness, with Eliminativism and 4E Cognition taken up: two fascinating and counterintuitive attempts to provide answers.",

What do we talk about when we talk about Otherness? When did the concept first appear in Western discourse?  How did “Othering” become a verb? Why is xenophobia surging across the Western world again? For phenomenologists—and infancy researchers–the awareness ofother mindsis thought to be a normative, even constitutive aspect of our very capacity for what Husserl termed, “transcendental subjectivity”: Infants become aware that objects and persons in the world arereallythere because of an implicit sense that they are available—or could be–to other experiencing subjects in a shared social world. And yet the capacity to maintain the sense of the other as a like-minded subject becomes a never-ending struggle—both in early infancy, and, as Hegel intimated, in the broad historical sense: We seem to live with the perennial possibility of either erasing the Other as subject—or being erased by the Other in turn. Can attending to the developmental and historical roots of Otherness help us understand—and even transcend the sort of Master-Slave dilemma that has so marked our current political moment—where, as the psychoanalyst/social theorist Jessica Benjamin puts it, “only one can live”?",
