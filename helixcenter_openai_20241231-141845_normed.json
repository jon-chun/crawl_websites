Professor Reeke trained as a protein crystallographer with Dick Marsh at Caltech and Bill Lipscomb at Harvard, where his Ph.D. thesis contained one of the first atomic coordinate sets for any protein, that of the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. He was brought to Rockefeller University in 1970 by Gerald Edelman, with whom he collaborated in a series of studies on the three-dimensional structures of proteins of interest for understanding the function of the immune system. He developed one of the first microprocessor-controlled lab instruments, an X-ray camera, and his Fourier synthesis software was used to solve many protein structures worldwide. Beginning in the late 1970’s, his interest has turned to problems of pattern recognition, perceptual categorization, and motor control, which he studies primarily through computer simulations of relevant neuronal systems. With Edelman’s group, he developed robots controlled by model brain-based networks; with Allan Coop, he developed a computationally efficient method for modeling the discharge activity of single neurons; with Coop, Wutu Lin, and Nick Watters, a series of methods for assessing the interval entropy of neuronal spike trains; with Valentin Piech, a model of low-level primate visual cortex; with Cameron Wellock, a model for song learning in birds and software for analyzing bird song; and with Kingsley Storer, a model for understanding the action of the anesthetic propofol on the central nervous system.

Professor Dougherty completed the MIT Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering studying the mathematical communication theories of Shannon, Turing, and von Neumann. He transferred to the Linguistics Department finishing a Ph.D. under Noam Chomsky on coordinate structures and recursion in language (1969). Digital Signal Processing (1982) used coding theories to design micro-circuitry for speech recognition and synthesis. Natural Language Computing (1994) offered a Chomsky grammar in Lisp and Prolog. Working with Konrad Lorenz (1976, 1980) led to an interest in formalizing animal sensori-motor capacities. Recent work with Stephen Wolfram on Cellular Automata (see A New Kind of Science ) forms the basis for a rather complete 3D computational graphics model of the operation and evolution of the modern human inner ear, and provides tools to compare the cochlea of lizards (disk), birds (cylinder), and mammals (triple concentric helical spiral). Since the cochlea-brain connection is an analog-digital converter, and sound complexities have clear Fourier/Poincare representations in mathematics, one can offer precise descriptions of how human sound processing capacities evolved over hundreds of millions of years, and account for anomalies like the mammalian platypus whose inner ear resembles that of the bird kingdom. Studying the computational universe of conceivable sound complexities and geometrically possible inner ears, one can show persuasively that Gould’s ‘saltations’ occurred at least twice in the evolution of the modern human ear from ancient creatures, one converting a cylinder (bird) cochlea to a helix (mammal), and also in the appearance of three parallel rows of hairs in the mammal cochlea. Most linguists focus on the evolution of the vocal tract, our group focusses mainly on the cochlea. The mouth serves dozens of different functions, the cochlea since its ancient birth, only detects vibrations and converts them to neural pulses. The computations required to analyze the cochlea parallel closely those required to design a sampling music synthesizer, and many students have worked on projects involving sampling synthesizers.",

    "date": "Saturday, March 9th, 2013",
    "time": "1:30 - 3:30PM",
    "description": "How do emotions color and shape our actions? How do we decide to take action in the midst of fear for our own lives–go to war, fight an intruder, save a person falling on subway tracks–or to ward off catastrophes such as global climate change and the irreversible loss of species that could lead to the extinction of our own species? This roundtable will focus on the role of fear in the valuation of life, and on how we respond to rare but extreme risk. Catastrophic circumstances inspire extreme fear, and this alters cognitive processes and behaviors deemed rational choices under more ordinary circumstances. Studying human responses to fear can broaden our very understanding of what constitutes rational choice. A branch of mathematics called Topology holds the trump card: it leads to new ways to understand rationality in a larger context to include ambiguity and apparent contradictions that emerge in all logical systems—a universal law that was discovered by Kurt Gödel last century and analyzed by Bertrand Russell. The roundtable discussion will bring to bear economic, neuroscientific, psychological, and other perspectives on fear, and topology as a geometric tool to help us visualize and update the concept of rationality and make it appropriate for our complex, ever changing, and challenging world.

Her remarkable gifts have been described in a variety of ways, but one gift repeatedly recognized by readers is her skill at recounting the results of her capacity for observation. As Randall Jarrell remarked in response to her very first book of poems, North & South: “All her poems have written underneath, ‘I have seen it.’” Perhaps the following precise and general praise by Howard Moss successfully suggests her specialness: “What Elizabeth Bishop brings to poetry is a new imagination; because of that, she is revolutionary, not ‘experimental.’ … Admired by critics, poets, and anyone genuinely interested in writing, her work is not easily labeled…. She is not academic, beat, cooked, raw, formal, informal, metrical, syllabic, or what have you. She is a poet pure and simple who has perfect pitch.” Four lovers of the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop—Bonnie Costello, Alice Quinn, Lloyd Schwartz, and Jean Valentine—will discuss what they admire about her poems and read aloud from her work.",

    "description": "Synthetic biology, and its sister field systems biology, offers the means to reengineer DNA in ways (and at a pace) that Nature, in her evolutionary wisdom, never envisioned. Standing at the unique crossroads of biology, engineering, computer science and neuroscience, these emerging fields are working toward the development of novel drugs and energy sources, the cure of disease and prolongation of life, and even the creation of new forms of life. Do synthetic and systems biology herald the true arrival of Promethean Man, who has thieved the very fire of transformation–the code of life–from the gods? Experts in synthetic and systems biology, molecular genetics and biomedical research, as well as a journalist of medical innovation, will offer their views on the aspirations–and pitfalls–of this brave new science.

G. Jung The concept of synchronicity was developed by the Nobel Laureate quantum physicist, Wolfgang Pauli and the Swiss psychiatrist C. Jung in the middle of the twentieth century. It stressed the empirical fact of meaningful coincidence—a special sense of coincidence of two or more causally unrelated events which have the same or similar meaning. Synchronistic phenomena cannot in principle be associated with conceptions of causality, and thus the interconnection of meaningful coincident factors must be thought of as acausal. While such occurrences are improbable from the perspective of causality, they are not infrequent. How may such phenomena be noted and approached today? Both physics and psychology explore mind on a continuum with matter, and so operate at the conjunctions of the mental and material. As an emergent meeting in the No-Time of fundamental physics and the tensed Time of daily life, synchronicity moves toward meaning at intersections of the objective and subjective, met both in our experimental sciences and in our felt registers of experience.",

It is a well-documented phenomenon that for all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, the gender gap widens in the progression from undergraduate study, through graduate and post-doctoral work, up through academic appointment. Do different scientific abilities or perspectives exist between genders? If so, to what degree are these the influence of nature versus nurture, the influences of biology, culture, and politics? How much sexism remains in the scientific profession? How much of it is borne by men? By women? What challenges have those women who have achieved success in the sciences faced? What work remains to further women’s progress in achieving equal opportunity with men in science, engineering, etc., in the lab, in the field, in the classroom, and in the boardroom? Our roundtable gathers women of high achievement who have thought hard—and fought hard—addressing these issues.",

    "description": "Throughout history, no other disease entity has exceeded cancer in its evocation of fear, taboo, misconceptions, and metaphors. In her 1978 book,Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag threw down the gauntlet in her denunciation of metaphor applied to illness, as leading to a false connection between psychological traits and disease, scorning the contemporaneous, popular notion of a “cancer personality,” that “[p]assion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses.” The advent of cellular, molecular and systems biology and genetics has profoundly altered our understanding of the biology of cancer. Such advances in knowledge help dispel fear and attenuate false metaphors; ironically, now over 35 years since Sontag’s treatise, the field of psychoneuroimmunology is revealing a truer picture of the influence of mind on cancer and the body’s immunity. What is the latest understanding of the biology of cancer? What role, if any, does the mind have on the development and course of cancer? Our roundtable convenes cutting-edge cancer researchers to explore these and other questions.",

Special focus areas of his work are lymphatic leukemias and lymphoma and he found that the process of translation, whereby a message RNA is ‘translated’ into the effector protein, is an understudied area in cancer that holds great promise for new therapies. Conveniently, nature –in the form of various plants, marine sponges, and corals – has also found translation to be a good target and a number of natural compounds exist that target this process. Their role in cancer is largely unknown, they have never been tested clinically, and this is an area Guido’s lab is most currently excited about."

For more information, consult the JPA websitewww.nyjung.orgor contact Allison Tuzo atJPA@nyjung.org How are mind and matter related? In the mid-20th century, the psychiatrist and analyst Carl Gustav Jung and the Nobel Laureate physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated the concept of synchronicity. They sought a philosophical answer to this still unsolved question of how the mental and material, the physical and psychological are related in time. Pauli and Jung’s thesis suggests two types of mind-matter correlations for synchronistic experiences in which meaning is crucial and pivotal. In this second roundtable on The Pauli-Jung Conjecture,” moderated by Beverley Zabriskie, Harald Atmanspacher and Joseph Cambray will further the April 2014 discussion at the Helix Center (video at www.helixcenter.org/videos/#/03Nq6MCh5Rc ). Edgar Choueiri and Farzad Mahootian will argue its central thesis, that the mental and the material are two complementary and intersecting aspects of one underlying reality.Atmanspacher will outline the speculations emerging from the conjecture’s “dual-aspect monism.” Using mental health care data, he will describe relevant psychophysical experiences from clinical settings. Cambray will discuss the significance of Atmanspacher’s research for a re-visioning of contemporary analysis and psychotherapy. Mahootian engages complementarity as an organizing principle in physical and social contexts, specifically in research laboratory settings. Choueiri, whose work focuses on space plasma physics and space exploration, will bring to bear questions which arise from applied science: the potential epiphanic role the theory of synchronicity can play, and the possible degeneration into the apophenia dreaded in experimental physics.",

Human aspiration, expressed in our science and in our spirituality, nevertheless seeks to transcend the philosophical and biological confines of mortality. How do differences in our awareness of mortality, from developmental death anxieties to the philosopher’s embrace, influence the diverse lives we lead? Can scientific advances, by giving us access to enhanced modes of perception and the possibilities of universes beyond our own, offer a way of transcending the death of the self? How have these advances, as well as enhancements in spiritual practice, contributed to ideas about life in the hereafter or in alternative realms?",

In addition to research concerned with the underlying mechanisms of meditation, Dr Malinowski’s projects also take an applied focus, for example addressing the questions: 1) if and how regular meditation practice can help staying cognitively fit in older age, 2) if and how meditation training in the workplace can unfold beneficial effects, 3) whether mindfulness-based surgery preparation can improve recovery, and 4) how mindful compassion practice can support carers of terminally ill individuals. He has published widely on meditation, ranging from cognitive neuroscience to positive psychology perspectives and including contributions to the Blackwell Companion to Consciousness and the Oxford Handbook of Happiness . He serves on the Board of Directors of the International Association Consciousness, Mindfulness, Compassion and is Associate Editor of Mindfulness .

In Kantian aesthetics, the sublime exists beyond the realm of the sensible: beyond form and purpose, but not beyond morality. How might the nature of the sublime differ in relation to visual arts, music, religious experience, nature itself? What can religion and philosophy, as well as psychology and neuroscience, teach us about the distinction between an experience of pleasure and the ecstasy of the sublime?",

She is currently an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University, Bloomington. Shapshay’s interests center on 19th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary aesthetics and ethics. Recently she has been reconstructing Schopenhauer’s theories of sublime experience and tragedy in a series of articles and book chapters : “The Problem and the Promise of the Sublime” in Suffering Art Gladly ed. Jerrold Levinson (Palgrave-Macmillan, 2013), “Schopenhauer’s Transformation of the Kantian Sublime” (Kantian Review, 2012), and “The Problem with the Problem of Tragedy: Schopenhauer’s Solution Revisited” ( British Journal of Aesthetics , 2012). She has also argued for the rehabilitation of the category of sublime experience in a paper titled “Contemporary Environmental Aesthetics and the Neglect of the Sublime” ( British Journal of Aesthetics , 2013). At present, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer’s Ethical Thought . In this book she argues that given a charitable reconstruction Schopenhauer’s ethics of compassion, it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape. She has been the recipient of a year-long fellowship as well as several research-travel grants from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) and has won two teaching awards, the John Eliot Outstanding Teacher Award from Portland State University and a Trustees Teaching Award from Indiana University."

Dr. Reiss directs a dolphin cognitive research program at the National Aquarium in Baltimore and is a research associate at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C. where she investigates elephant cognition. She was director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the Osborn Laboratories of Marine Sciences at the New York Aquarium and co-chair of the Animal Enrichment Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society. Dr. Reiss served as a science advisor of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Dr. Reiss’s research focuses on cetacean cognition, communication, comparative animal cognition, and the evolution of intelligence. She pioneered the use of underwater keyboards with dolphins to investigate their cognitive and communicative abilities and provide them with more degrees of choice and control. Dr. Reiss and her colleagues demonstrated that bottlenose dolphins and Asian elephants possess the rare ability for mirror self-recognition, previously thought to be restricted to humans and great apes. Her efforts also involve the rescue and rehabilitation of stranded marine mammals including the successful rescue of the renowned Humphrey, the humpback whale in the San Francisco Bay waters. Her advocacy work in conservation and animal welfare includes the protection of dolphins in the tuna-fishing industry and efforts to bring an end to the killing of dolphins in the drive hunts in Japan. Her recent book The Dolphin in the Mirror was released in the fall 2011."

How does this recast the “nature versus nurture” debate in the language of multifactorial inheritance, epistatic interaction, and transcriptomics?

Champagne Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University.  Dr. Champagne’s main research interest concerns how genetic and environmental factors interact to shape the brain and behavior through epigenetic changes in gene expression. Studies in rodents suggest that the quality of maternal care received in infancy can lead to long-term changes in offspring gene expression and behavior.  Dr. Champagne’s current and ongoing research explores the implications of these influences for the transmission of behavior across generations and the molecular mechanisms through which these effects are achieved.  Dr. Champagne uses rodent models to study epigenetics, neurobiology, and behavior and also collaborates with clinical researchers who would like to apply the study of epigenetics to better understand origins of variation in human behavior.  In addition to investigating the modulating effects of mother-infant interactions, Dr. Champagne is currently exploring a broad array of social influences and environmental exposures and is exploring the mechanisms of risk vs. resilience to such early life experiences. Dr. Champagne received an MSc in Psychiatry (1999) and PhD in Neuroscience (2004) from McGill University.   In 2007 she received an NIH Director’s New Innovator Award and her research is funded by NIMH and NIEHS.

    "description": "Why is translation, which formerly referred to a set of restricted technical procedures taking place between two languages, now widely understood to be the basis of all human culture? What is it about this dynamic principle of displacement, exchange, and creative renewal that also links it to the exercise of political power and the possession of linguistic/literary capital? Why do some still consider it a necessary evil, while others regard it as a testimony to the rich diversity of human expression? Because its processes are so pervasive a feature of thought and experience, we must ask, on the one hand, does anything escape translation? And on the other hand, we must also ask, is everything (ultimately) translatable?  Translation Studies as a field has grown tremendously in the last two decades. This event will focus on translation as a psychic, aesthetic, and cultural phenomenon. We are extremely fortunate to have with us a group of celebrated literary translators and theorists of translation, who work in different languages and across genres and periods. Their distinctive insights into this most significant and challenging enterprise will remind us of the countless ways we all live in translation and are subject to its elusive and reverberating implications.",

The distinguished members of the Comité and the Freud Fund are thus most pleased to inaugurate a series of international conferences in dialogue with American peers, through the joint sponsorship of the Helix Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. Professors in the humanities and social sciences, psychoanalysts, and cultural and political personages will hold roundtable discussions on three themes: The ordinary, psycho-physiological preconditions of identity formation, which characteristically belong to a closed system (whether familial, national, linguistic, or religious), are, in effect, all encompassing and exclusionary.  Freud’s teachings on the psychology of the masses – usually far removed from educational programs – are required  to make a clear distinction between the homeland (patrie,the open political system decided by the will of the citizens) and thenation(a closed, blood-related system embodying a will ascribed to a hypothetical ancestral founder). The latter definition is even more applicable to religious communities, accounting for the possible integration of civil and religious powers. Freud held that education was one of the impossible professions, along with government and psychoanalysis. The growing secularization of the individual world leads to the belief that one can expect more gratification from an organic connection to the environment than from spiritual and communal connections. If that is the case, what is there to teach other than technological pragmatism, that is to say, tools adapted to mere organismic life, and the idea of “every man for himself”? The voice of God-as-Savior, which was heretofore hoped for and beloved, has no more currency in our world, now obscured or extinguished by the din of the music and the messages blaring continuously through our headphones. The voice of the teacher is lost, stifled by that of entertainment. If, as Hegel put forth, the primary desire of man is not to satisfy basic needs, but rather to be recognized, then his last recourse – which was once the guiding voice of God – is the desire to know. Perhaps we are now tasked with facilitating access to, or rather, midwifing the rebirth – since it was present at our Hellenic origins – of something akin to the ruckus of the gods. In a context of globalizing consumerism, the cultural uniformity of lifestyles and behaviors may provoke an exacerbation of identity problems, an autarchic withdrawal, the selling out of law, and manifold social violence. Such phenomena are found almost everywhere, in conjunction with an unprecedented and unrelenting economic and social crisis, tied to resurfacing nationalism and populism, and to the brutal expression of religious fundamentalism. The world’s democracies are in jeopardy. Nationalism feeds off of a double illusion: the ego-ideal joins with the momentum of the crowds led by lawless leaders, and with a view towards satisfying uninhibited drives (desires) without exterior constraint. As a consequence, the fringes of the population are further marginalized and are ready to “withdraw from reality.” In the face of this malaise, the political response is muffled by the noises and resentments of the masses. “Whenever I have expressed feelings of national exaltation,” wrote Freud, “I have tried to suppress them as disastrous and unfair.” He wrote elsewhere, “Fools, visionaries, sufferers from delusions, neurotics and lunatics have played great roles at all times in the history of mankind and not merely when the accident of birth had bequeathed them sovereignty. Usually they have wreaked havoc; but not always.” Freudian knowledge represents a return to reason, against the downward slide of identity crisis, religious and nationalist extremism; it gives meaning to humanism and cosmopolitanism.",

Conveniently, nature –in the form of various plants, marine sponges, and corals – has also found translation to be a good target and a number of natural compounds exist that target this process.

She has a special interest in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, and how different conditions can affect the processing of emotions expressed not only by facial expression, but also by gaze and by body language. For her research, she has been using different techniques including fMRI, MEG and eye-tracking. She has authored more than 80 peer-reviewed paper, some of them highly cited, and is the author of a book as well as several book chapters. Recently, she was the author of a paper showing that contrary to what had been thought, individuals with autism do not lack affective empathy and that their seemingly uncaring behavior stems from personal distress and lack of ability to reappraise when observing pain in others, rather than from an absence of concern.

Is one’s contentedness with one’s life the sole measure of a life going well? Is the pleasure one gets good or is one’s getting it the thing that makes it good (in other words, is it good for oneself because it seems good to oneself)? How does one’s happiness comport with the welfare of others? Are some pleasures more valuable than others? Is happiness necessary for a good life? The above questions are a mere sampling of the many ways our roundtable will explore the meaning of happiness and the profound epistemological questions of ethics it evokes, as well as consider the role of positive psychology in raising awareness and provoking controversies regarding the ways we define and measure happiness and thence shape socioeconomic theories and policies.",

So, as proposed by Grady Booch, let’s imagine unleashing a technology platform using natural language processing and machine learning, such as IBM’s Watson, in the physical world. Give it eyes, ears, and touch, then let it act in that world with hands and feet and a face, not just as an action of force but also as an action of influence. This is embodied cognition: by placing the cognitive power of such a platform in a robot, in an avatar, an object in your hand, or even in the walls of an operating room, conference room, or spacecraft, we take a Watson’s ability to understand and reason and draw it closer to the natural ways in which humans live and work. In so doing, we augment individual human senses and abilities, giving that technology platform the ability see a patient’s complete medical condition, feel the flow of a supply chain, or drive a factory like a maestro before an orchestra.",

For many years, it was thought to be a rare disorder, resulting from a bad relationship of the children with their so-called refrigerator mothers. However, there is clear evidence now that autism results from abnormalities in brain development, and that the behavior observed in children is the consequence of disturbances in brain circuitry. We will explore the history of the diagnosis and treatment of this entity, current approaches and how they reflect advances in our understanding of the mind-brain.",

She has a special interest in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, and how different conditions can affect the processing of emotions expressed not only by facial expression, but also by gaze and by body language. For her research, she has been using different techniques including fMRI, MEG and eye-tracking. She has authored more than 80 peer-reviewed paper, some of them highly cited, and is the author of a book as well as several book chapters. Recently, she was the author of a paper showing that contrary to what had been thought, individuals with autism do not lack affective empathy and that their seemingly uncaring behavior stems from personal distress and lack of ability to reappraise when observing pain in others, rather than from an absence of concern.

Her clinical insights have led her to challenge some of the longest-held assumptions and beliefs in science and society about the origin and control of behavior and emotions. Dr. Welch leads a multidisciplinary team of researchers that is providing a new scientific understanding of the biological underpinnings of family nurture. Dr. Welch’s revolutionary Calming Cycle theory posits that emotions arise from bodily-based co-conditioning mechanisms in mother and infant/child. The theory proposes that states of emotional dysregulation stem from the lack of co-regulation and can be counter-conditioned through regular mother/child calming sessions. Accordingly, symptomatic behavior can be eliminated through establishing and maintaining a co-regulatory process within the family nurture system at home. This hypothesis contradicts the prevailing theories that propose that emotional states are best ameliorated by helping a child to self-regulate. Among basic research findings, Dr, Welch’s lab discovered the oxytocin receptor in the epithelium and enteric nervous system of the gut and showed that a combination of nurture peptides treat an animal model of colitis."

    "description": "What is it to feel pain? We sense it in the body, as a non-trivial, unmediated and imperative perceptual event associated with tissue damage, possessing particular spatiotemporal characteristics of a physical object (e.g., location, quantity, intensity, duration). Pain, nevertheless, is also a subjective event—i.e., is an experience itself, not merely the representation of an object of a perceptual experience—residing on an affective-emotional axis. It seems self-evident that pain is a biologically functional “good” in promoting a hierarchy of behaviors to restore a homeostatic organismic state. What is the latest scientific understanding of pain and its management, the role of analgesics, particularly opioids, their use and abuse? How do we advance the science of pain ethically with respect to humans and other species?",

Over the past two decades my lab has been devoted to unravelling the brain mechanisms underlying chronic back pain (CBP), which has culminated in over 50 papers and a current clinical trial designed to arrest the development of CBP. In the process we have developed sophisticated methodologies that can be readily extended to the other most burdensome chronic pain condition, knee osteoarthritis (OA).  I have pioneered the use of brain imaging technology to delineate brain biomarkers of chronic pain, resulting in many “firsts” in and beyond the field of pain research: the first identification of grey matter atrophy related to chronic pain, the first account of brain activity unique to spontaneous fluctuations of chronic pain, the first characterization of brain resting state network abnormalities in chronic pain, the first determination of mesocorticolimbic biomarkers predicting pain chronification, the first parallel human-rodent neuroimaging of the transition to chronic pain, the first demonstration of the critical role of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in neuropathic pain, the first identification of brain biomarkers for placebo response propensity, and more. These observations have been replicated across multiple international laboratories. With over 14,603 citations, my h index is 58. My laboratory’s ongoing work translates these observations to human and rodent neuroimaging studies that explore the disruption of emotional learning in subacute and chronic pain. It has become clear to me that prevention and treatment of chronic pain require aggressive and creative research to disentangle the mesocorticolimbic circuitry. This work would not have been possible without the enthusiasm, creativity, and persistence of the large number of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows whom I have trained.”",

    "description": "A nomenclator was a slave whose duty was to accompanying his master in canvassing the streets of Classical Rome in order to recall the names of those his master encountered. Each of us is, in a way, both that ancient politician and that slave, relying on others’ memories to supply us with knowledge, and others relying on us for the knowledge we recall for them. Hence, knowledge has always been, in part, a distributive entity, requiring a delegation of mental tasks, an implicit commitment to a social contract. Histories have documented the occurrence of mass delusions—which also leads us to question our collective intuition. Close to the origins of humankind is a fascination with the unknown and the unverifiable, with the early cultivation of spiritual life and religion proving as a testament to this. What is apocryphal and what should believe in? Even to the present day, as technology and science become evermore complicated, we are asked to distinguish between proven fact and educated speculation. In the age of a seemingly omniscient internet, an impersonal cloud-mind (with which—despite attempts to humanize Siri and “her” ilk—no one can yet lay claim outside of fiction to a convincing reciprocal emotional relationship), when the object of our confided ignorance is no longer a person but a thing, when our subjective sense of self is no longer limned by the encounter with another, what happens to our ability to distinguish internal from external knowledge? Are we led to an illusory sense of our own knowledge? Is the immediate, distributive information of the internet changing the way our brains work, possibly holding the promise of transcending the limitations of individual knowledge? If so, does the virtue of its collective knowledge lead us further to question the very value of our individuality? Or are we heedlessly (or ineluctably) heading toward a human-machine collective heretofore only within the purview of science fiction? There is great excitement in the scientific community about the prospect of forming a transitive partnership with a seemingly unlimited source of knowledge. Where, however, is the place of wisdom? Does more information, more knowledge, inevitably lead to superior opinions, decision-making, and moral understanding? Is collective knowledge always less susceptible to the pretense of knowledge that individual thinking is? The history of human advancement would suggest otherwise, replete as it is with counterexamples to the superiority of collective knowledge over individual reasoning",

Which poets are doing interesting or important work? Who are the earlier poets that inspired them? And what is the nature, role, appeal and significance of contemporary poetry? When it comes to grasping experiences and communicating their meaning, what does this art form provide that fiction, journalism, academic writing, film, and other genres do not? Indeed, in this age of sociopolitical turmoil, Internet overload, media saturation, and often chaotic or reductive thinking, in what sense does poetry offer deeper, more gratifying kinds of engagement? In response to questions such as these, a roundtable of diverse and accomplished poets will discuss what is going on in the poetry world today. They will explore the allure and value of contemporary poetry through different lenses—conceptual, musical, visual, literary, sociopolitical, and psychological.

    "description": "We have every reason to believe that different disciplines and dedications have much to gain from each other. Imhotep, one of the earliest polymaths, was a physician, astronomer, and an engineer—but, as an architect, he also had a gift for design, and as a poet, a penchant for the art of writing. Far away, millennia later, Zhang Heng became noted in the histories of the Han Dynasty as an early scientist and scholar, although this was not at any expense for talent of art, as his contemporary wrote that “the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods.” Likewise, from the works of Da Vinci and Hildegard de Bingen, to geniuses of our time, the bond between the sciences and art is observed across the world and throughout the ages. This is not just true within individuals or a phenomenon seen in great thinkers alone. Our quotidian experience tells us so, abundant with the evidence of each field’s dependence on, and advancement of, the other: from the drawing of star maps and anatomical sketches to the math and physics of optics and perspective, to the latest technological advances in computer design. Two cultures converge as we discuss the significance of art and science in this three day series. Tickets now on sale.Click here to purchase at EventBrite.

    "description": "Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould’s drawings of Darwin’s finches to the success story of Steve Jobs’ Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences. What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in?

His new book, Paper Minds: Literature and the Ecology of Consciousness (Chicago, 2018), asks what distinctive knowledge the literary disciplines and literary form can contribute to discussions of perceptual consciousness, created and natural environments, and skilled engagement with the world. Portions have appeared in Critical Inquiry, Representations, and elsewhere. Before that, Actions and Objects from Hobbes to Richardson (Stanford, 2010) considered representations of mind and material objects along with theories of action during the long eighteenth century. And before that, Making the English Canon: Print Capitalism and the Cultural Past, 1700-1770 (Cambridge, 1999) examined the role of criticism and aesthetic theory in the creation of a national literary tradition. His current research is on the aesthetics and perception of designed environments, including the garden, the park, and the house.

Envisioned is a near future in which human bodies and minds will be transformed and enhanced through genomics, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and any number of prosthetic devices inside and outside our bodies. Advocates also hold out the possibilities of radical life extension through rejuvenation technologies or alternately reincarnating individuals inside of computers. The proponents of transhumanism argue that the exponential growth in scientific knowledge and know-how is leading humanity to a “Singularity” sometime in the mid 21st century. In that Singularity, our technologies will cross a threshold. We will become post- or trans-humans.

    "description": "Schopenhauer described boredom as “a tame longing without any particular object,” Dostoevsky as “ a bestial and indefinable affliction,” and poet Joseph Brodsky as “time’s invasion of your world system.” Unsurprisingly, not many can describe boredom even though most have felt it, and it is one of the central preoccupations of the age. The most current definition comes from John Eastwood in Toronto: Drawing from research across many areas of psychological science and neuroscience, Eastwood and colleagues define boredom as “an aversive state of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity,” which arises from failures in one of the brain’s attention networks. Interestingly, people who investigate boredom, find it thus: “Boredom is a blast! To a curious and creative scholar, nothing is ever too trivial.”(Maureen Corrigan re Patricia Meyer Spacks’ book of that name) And, “Peter Toohey “finds a perverse kind of glee in his subject.” (Daily Telegraph) Curiously the subject seems to ingivorate those who study it. We hope that this roundtable will, in bringing together scholars from literature, psychiatry, neurology, cultural history, and the law who have thought deeply about the subject, continue the exploration of the meaning and characteristics of boredom, and in so doing give the audience a chance to enlarge their own ideas.",

Or is reality subject to multiple ontological levels, in the words of philosopher Nancy Cartwright, “a patchwork of laws,” opening the door to the disunity of, a plurality of, sciences? On the one hand, if one asserts that all of reality comes within the sweeping compass of a unified science, what, then, of the ontological and epistemological standing of the humanities? On the other hand, if not, does this rescue the humanities from the ascendancy of science, from the power of evidential, empirical veridicality, of a discipline founded on the phenomenal, over one founded on the noumenal?

    "title": "Creative Turbulence Art Exhibition",
    "date": "",
    "time": "",
    "description": "Creative Turbulence is an art exhibition that brings together art and science through a collaborative creative process in the form of four unique works of art. By pairing artists with scientists, we are challenging traditional notions of scientific perception, expanding the artists’ access to science, and engaging viewers in a new way of understanding science. The exhibition methodology is based on the underlying nature of experimentation shared by both scientists and artists. The scientific component of Creative Turbulence is based in physics–-working within the fields of fluid dynamics, turbulence, and complex systems. The artistic component of Creative Turbulence is based on existing artistic research and medium specific processes that relate to physics, through the process of making the work or as represented directly in the artistic output itself. Art ExhibitionViewing Hours:Saturday, June 9th, 2:00pm to 5:00 pmMonday, June 11th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmTuesday, June 12th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmWednesday, June 13th, 10:00 am to 5:00 pmThursday, June 14th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmFriday, June 15th, 10:00 am to 9:00 pmSaturday, June 16th, 12:00 pm to 4:00pm A variety of artworks will be on display, including: “Atmospheric Memory” (from artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer in collaboration with NYU Tandon School of Engineering researcher Enrico Fonda and Georgia Tech’s Devesh Ranjan) was inspired by Charles Babbage’s theory that spoken words have an everlasting impact on the universe. Lozano-Hemmer uses vegetable glycerin and glycol to capture the 3D form of air turbulence as it exists the mouth of a volunteer, then created a permanent 3D version of the breath. Lozano-Hemmer displayed another piece in the series at Art Basel in Miami in 2016. “Collective Motion” (from artist David McLeod in collaboration with NYU Tandon Professor of Mechanical Engineering Maurizio Porfiri) uses state-of-the-art animation software to visualize the behavior of interactive agents that organize themselves in a collective motion. The concept is related to flocking (as birds do) and schooling (as fish do) – and more broadly to non-equilibrium systems undergoing a phase transition. The structured behavior of these active particles bridges the gap between the motion of living things and the motion of inactive matter, such as in classical fluid dynamics. “Immutable Swell” (from artist and NYU Tandon Integrated Digital Media Lecturer Dana Karwas) is a sculptural representation of an ocean wave as it breaks onto land. She created the artwork by extracting over 500,000 data points from a custom buoy sensor placed in the waters of Cape Cod. This data was combined with her own personal experience of swimming in the ocean to emerge as a complex 3D digital inscription of an ocean wave. By using software and motion analysis to observe the wave from a digital distance, Karwas was able to distill invisible structures in the wave. “Immutable Swell” represents an opportunity for viewers to make a connection to the powerful turbulence and mysterious patterns found in the ocean. “Nimbus Atlas II” (from artist Berndnaut Smilde) consists of a series of high-definition videos depicting human-made clouds emerging and decomposing in a void. The footage was captured with a high-speed camera, resulting in a slow-motion visualization of how clouds evolve, change shape, and reflect light. (His “indoor clouds” were recognized by Time Magazine as among the “Top Ten Inventions of 2012.”) Also available for viewing is the work of physicist Daniel P. Lathrop, who pioneered visualization techniques that make it possible to observe the mysteries of quantum fluids – which exhibit quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level – with the naked eye. Lathrop collaborated with physicist and NYU Tandon Dean Katepalli R. Sreenivasan and used superfluid helium, which flows without friction and exists only near absolute zero. “The strong visual component of many of the investigations being done in fluid dynamics makes it easy to showcase the results to a lay audience in a compelling and immediate way,” said Fonda, who organized the exhibit and roundtable. “Fluids are a part of everyone’s daily life – from stirring coffee, taking a shower, and applying perfume to flying or driving in various conditions – so everyone has at least an intuitive feel for how fluids behave. I think people find it easier to relate to this work than to other topics in physics, which despite being fascinating are more abstract and seemingly less applicable to their lives.” The connection between art and turbulence came to public attention in 2004, when NASA released images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys that looked remarkably like the luminescent swirls depicted in Vincent van Gogh’s famous painting “Starry Night.” A multinational team of physicists subsequently explored the relationship between the turbulencevan Gogh depicted and the natural phenomenon of fluid turbulence and found a shockingly precise – and inexplicable – mathematical correlation that continues to confound scientists and art historians today.",

They study the contribution of various genetic risk factors in disease pathogenesis. Recently, the Toth laboratory became interested in environmental risk-factors in psychiatric disease (including early adverse care, sedentary lifestyle, chronic societal stress, psychological trauma, and drug use) because environment-induced disease conditions, similar to genetic conditions, can propagate across generations. Although explaining disease pathogenesis and heritability of genetic conditions is relatively straightforward, how adverse environment can cause psychiatric disease is more complicated to understand, as it often occurs long after the exposure and propagate to descendant who were never exposed to the environment. Using mouse models, the Toth Lab aims to build and experimentally test a theoretical framework that explains the principles behind environmentally induced epigenetic alterations that are directly linked to disease pathogenesis (https://www.tothlab.com/, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/miklos.toth.1/bibliography/40692716/public/?sort=date&direction=descending)."

Some proofs, however, are so long or complex, or both, that they cannot be checked for errors by human experts.  In response, a small but growing community of mathematicians, collaborating with computer scientists, have designed systems that allow proofs to be verified by machine.  The success in certifying proofs of some prestigious theorems has led some mathematicians to propose a complete rethinking of the profession, requiring future proofs to be written in computer readable code.  A few mathematicians have gone so far as to predict that artificial intelligence will replace humans in mathematical research, as in so many other activities. One’s position on the possible future mechanization of proof is a function of one’s view of mathematics itself.  Is it a means to an end that can be achieved as well, or better, by a competent machine as by a human being?   If so, what is that end, and why are machines seen as more reliable than humans?  Or is mathematics rather an end in itself, a human practice that is pursued for its intrinsic value?   If so, what could that value be, and can it ever be shared with machines?",

It stands for the essential unity of that subject despite the enormous range of different interests of biologists—from proteins to the behavior of elephants to medical applications. Is there an analogous ’unifying anchor’ for Mathematics? Is Mathematics unified and does it make sense to talk of the beauty of mathematics? Mathematical language is one unifying force, and the subject is laced with analogies linking radically different intuitions, the classical example being algebra and geometry. More modern syntheses bring together a vast range of mathematical sensibilities, accomplishments, truths, and applications. Might one argue that these analogies augment the sense of beauty that (some) people feel when they engage in mathematical ideas?",

    "date": "",

    "description": "“Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?” This familiar courtroom oath unpacks some of the subtleties of truth-telling. Making true statements is not all there is to it. What one says may be true, but what is omitted in the telling may present a false picture. And one may tell the truth, but that testimony may be distorted by the commingling of some untruths. True statements come embedded in a matrix of linked propositions whose truth value we often cannot personally vouch for: Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, Oswald killed Kennedy, and quarks come in six flavors are good examples of such claims. Many true beliefs are built upon claims we must take for granted as foundational, typically based on authority or on what those around us believe to be the case. A false statement, told willingly and with foreknowledge of its falsehood, is how we define lying. But we can be misled by a simple and straightforward claim – especially if we are motivated to believe it – when some of its many underlying claims are distorted or manipulated for the purpose of dissembling. When it comes to liars, the subtleties deepen. It is often said that “pathological liars” believe the lies they make up, and this is what contributes to their lying and their effectiveness as liars. We hear people ask: “Did Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos know she was lying or were her claims merely wishful thinking?” Of the many notions, large or small, expressed by liars, how many are directly contradictory to their firsthand awareness of the facts on the ground and how many based on flimsy premises only dimly considered or validated? How many of these premises are highlighted out of proportion to other known facts or elided entirely just to make their case? There are numerous psychological and neuropsychiatric studies of liars, confabulators, and sociopaths. Tales of fabulists – Baron Münchausen perhaps the most well-known – make for popular reading just because each liar is unique, and the vicissitudes of their wishes and dreams present a thrill-ride of impending disclosure. The variety of “tangled webs” give some indication of what makes these tales so fascinating. Our panel today will be analyzing these many facets to what liars do when they are lying.",

Her research seeks to understand how individuals make trade-offs between different values, and how this influences decision-making and social perception. Her main stream of research investigates the tension between honesty and benevolence. Many of our most common and difficult ethical dilemmas involve balancing honesty and benevolence. We routinely face this conflict in our personal lives, when deciding how to communicate with friends and family members, and in our professional lives, when deciding how to deliver difficult news and critical feedback. Honesty and benevolence also conflict during some of our most demanding and emotional ethical decisions. For example, when healthcare professionals communicate information to sick and elderly individuals, they must strike a delicate balance between providing hope and care, and communicating honestly. Using a variety of research methods, in both the laboratory and the field, Levine studies how individuals navigate this tension. Her research unearths specific circumstances in which people welcome and appreciate deception, as well as circumstances in which they underestimate the benefits of honesty.",

Some proofs, however, are so long or complex, or both, that they cannot be checked for errors by human experts. In response, a small but growing community of mathematicians, collaborating with computer scientists, have designed systems that allow proofs to be verified by machine. The success in certifying proofs of some prestigious theorems has led some mathematicians to propose a complete rethinking of the profession, requiring future proofs to be written in computer readable code. A few mathematicians have gone so far as to predict that artificial intelligence will replace humans in mathematical research, as in so many other activities. One’s position on the possible future mechanization of proof is a function of one’s view of mathematics itself. Is it a means to an end that can be achieved as well, or better, by a competent machine as by a human being? If so, what is that end, and why are machines seen as more reliable than humans? Or is mathematics rather an end in itself, a human practice that is pursued for its intrinsic value? If so, what could that value be, and can it ever be shared with machines?",

With the growing success of physics and other sciences, the idea of one fundamental ontology, that of  particles and fields, became dominant as a physicalist version of ontology. However, as every hegemonial view creates alternatives, this one does too. This roundtable addresses two of them: (1) the Platonic idea that mathematics is prior to the tangible world of our experience, and (2) the idea of a tiered ontology, where each of its levels can achieve legitimate ontological significance. Both views reject the fundamental ontology of physicalist accounts, but they do so in different ways that will be discussed in this roundtable.

    "description": "The starting point of this roundtable discussion is Joseph LeDoux’s book,The Deep History of Ourselves: The Four-Billion-Year Story of How We Got Conscious Brains. LeDoux’s research on how the brain detects and responds to danger helped jumpstart and define the modern science of emotion. After three decades, he came to the realization that the commonly received conception of human emotions as evolutionarily pre-formed states of mind is wrong. InThe Deep History of Ourselves, he used the four-billion year story of life to explain why. His key insight was that single-cell microbes, the ancient ancestors of  modern day bacteria, had the same basic survival requirements we do—they had to detect danger, search for and incorporate nutrients, balance fluids and ions, and reproduce. When we do these things, we feel fear, hunger, thirst, and pleasure, and assume that these states underlie our behavior. But the purpose of these ancient processes has little direct relation to these psychological states, which came much later. Emotions, he concluded, result from our efforts to make sense of the significant moments in our lives. And to do this requires the precise kind of brain we have. Discussing these ideas with LeDoux will be experts from a range of scientific areas, including evolutionary biology (Niklas), the cognitive neuroscience of emotion (Lindquist), psychiatry (Hurowitz), and the philosophy of consciousness (Rosenthal).",

    "description": "Justice is blind, the saying goes, which means that a person’s particulars – their social status, race, gender, etc. – should have no bearing on fair judgement in any legal dispute. By this standard, we are all considered equal before the law. In A Theory of Justice, the philosopher John Rawls proposed the following thought experiment: what kind of society and government would you choose if you did not know beforehand the role you would play in that society? Imagining yourself an anonymous, “random” person — raceless, genderless, and classless — in other words “blinded” to your own particulars, what would you endorse as the fairest system for the distribution of assets, of opportunity and obligation for the citizenry?And now imagine Justice wearing Xray glasses! Artificial Intelligence has arrived, and by hoovering up personal data at an increasing rate, data we are often even unaware of “emitting” — the rhythm of daily movement and sleep, vocal patterns and word choice frequencies — we have begun to disclose information that in many instances exceeds what we know about ourselves. To the holders of this information we are the furthest thing from anonymous. Now consider how this utter loss of anonymity might ultimately impact how society distributes assets and opportunity, and how it dictates each individual’s obligation to the state.Machine learning and other AI algorithms are being used in a wide variety of contexts, including medical and legal decision-making, in addition to ad targeting, mortgage risk and sentencing recommendation systems, etc. The existing database already creates a cyber-profile for each of us at a level of resolution inconceivable just a decade ago. And then, of course, computers are inference engines, and these high-resolution profiles spit out predictions about our choices and behaviors that we have no role in vetting. Based on this “number crunching” we may be thrown into categories we did not even know existed, with important implications. And then there is the worry: will AI serve us in our best interest? The fictional HAL 9000 computer in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey was designed to serve mankind but ran dramatically afoul of this credo. Should we begin now to consider the rules of engagement between ourselves and the super-intelligent machine agents we may reasonably anticipate? As the use of AI algorithms grows more and more prevalent, it is important that we think hard about the ethical, legal, and social implications of these technologies and their myriad current and potential future uses.",

    "date": "",
    "time": "",
    "description": "Memory is not a dusty cellar, open treasure chest, or sealed pandora’s box. It is a dynamic process, a stream of renditions and reflections. It conveys to us not what strictly happened, but embeds us in a retained internal moment, in an external encounter, or an imprint from another’s story. Memory re-enforces, revises, re-edits, and re-interprets as we grapple with the present and look forward to the imminent and not so immediate future. Memory is paradoxical: privately phenomenological and yet irreducibly entwined in family or group, subjective yet sculpted by others’ reflections; reflected in one’s mirror yet refracted through the lens of a culture, religion, and history. Our memory may resonate with the memories of others, individual and collective, and become thereby fortified, annexed, or diluted. Implicit memories are subliminal, subconscious, often dormant in the body of an organism until awakened by association, affordance, and circumstance. Explicit memories, on the other hand, form the quilt-like narratives of ourselves. The past may magnify or muffle the presence of our current selves. And it can do both. Throughout life, we form and reform particular memories from a protean sort of raw material, from the freshly perceived and from the recycled and reverberated. Memory can embitter and it can bring wisdom. It can soothe, entertain, or distress and re-traumatize. Whether implicit or explicit, positive or negative, we fear the loss of memory, both the short and the long term, and experience it as a theft of personhood, a ghostly vanishing of the self amidst recognized others and familiar settings. Simple lapses of recall can be frightening for some, an omen of a coming loss of one’s being in the world. The neuroscientist Gerald Edelman described consciousness as “the remembered present”, a dynamic, emergent, and ongoing narrative by which we continue the search to find ourselves both in the universe of generations, and our singular lived lives.",

In 2010, she helped start her local newspaper, The Sandisfield Times , and contributed as managing editor and staff photographer.  In 2015 those interests of art, history and journalism converged in an online project called the Freedom from Fear/Yellow Bowl Project .  Using her ceramics and photography, her work explores what it means to be an “American” and questions what freedom could mean to different groups at different times in American history through the lens of the mass incarceration of people of Japanese ethnicity in the United States during WWII.  The project included traveling across the US twice to some of the most remote parts of the country covering over 16,000 miles to get to all ten US concentration camps as they were called by the FDR administration. In 2016, the artist was invited to create a site-specific image at the FDR Library and Museum in Hyde Park, NY.  The following year her contemporary images from the former camps were included as part of a yearlong photography exhibition in commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of FDR’s signing of Executive Order 9066.

    "description": "“Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.” – James Madison, Federalist Paper No. 10 Populism refers to the political mobilization of “the people” against a perceived elite caste of professional politicians. And whereas a corps of elected representatives was Madison’s and Hamilton’s buffer against the tyranny of factions, from time to time the political class may come to be viewed as insufficiently attentive to the needs of their constituents and then become the target and nidus that creates a populist movement. What causes such mass movements and are they usually kept in check by the designs laid out in the Federalist Papers? What sorts of perceived failures on the part to the ruling class may provoke such movements, and when do these factors lead to right- versus left-wing populism? When do such movements form around notions of nationalism, classism, religion, xenophobia, or domestic oppression? Do anomie, alienation, or social humiliation play a role? What has been the effect of social media in catalyzing populist movements around the globe?",

    "description": "Placebos “work” for quite a few medical problems. But how? And what is the work they do? What one thinks a medicine is capable of, one’s idea of that medicine, may affect us in the way “proper” medicines do. This implies that, in observing the work of a placebo we are watching an idea affect biology, the mind moving the body. Despite the dualist notions this description elicits, where mind and body are held as separate entities, most neuroscientists, generally of a monistic bent, welcome the challenge of the placebo effect. Most insist that placebos precisely demonstrate that the mind is one with the body. Yet, fabulous stories of placebo cures, both astounding and well-confirmed, produce the evidence but not yet a complete account linking belief to cure. By what mechanisms do our thoughts affect our health? Are placebos a special case of how ideas impact our physical selves; or rather, does this open a window into how all thinking works? The inverse of the placebo, the nocebo effect, produces rather than mitigates symptoms. Here an inert substance believed to be a “poison” can essentially poison us. More commonly, physicians worry about “suggestibility,” when, for example, a patient insists “if anyone will get that side-effect, it’ll be me.” At the same time, many patients refuse to consider that their “psychology” has anything to do with the symptoms they experience. But if we wish to move away from the notion that the nocebo effect is “all in one’s head,” what then is suggestibility? What accounts for the range of responses in the population to the placebo and nocebo effects?History chronicles the universal desire to stave off illness, to lesser or greater degrees a concern of all cultures. What we now refer to as the placebo effect evolved out of the mythical and magical practices of the shaman. But, with a modern belief system less conducive to shamanism, the “inert” placebo is often viewed as deceptive. Might we yet arrive at an ethical reliance on placebo treatment, both to determine and then harness their evident value in promoting emotional and physical health?",

    "description": "A testament to its ubiquity, STRESS is woven into our very words, our thoughts and our emotions. Westresswords to give them emphasis. Westresswood to make it stronger rather than splinter. And we feel distress, both when overwhelmed with dread, but also sometimes in joyous anticipation. The chase creates stress. Loss and failure create stress. Even attaining the prize, whether chosen or befallen, can also deliver stress, and plenty, along with its winnings. Change often means stress. Stress is the white noise of life, whether we perceive it or somehow manage to habituate to it. Of late our culture has grown more attuned to the semiotics of stress, as it expresses itself in our brains and guts, our minds and bodies, our spirit and imagination. When it derives from a goal achieved, it may serve as fuel. But, with a pain inflicted, when choice is not possible, when we are the object rather the subject, stress corrosively imprints identity and erodes our resilience and potential for realization. Current research reveals the severe effects of stress on the brain. It halts development, hinders plasticity, and entangles and ensnares the inner workings of our cells. Stress is tantamount to aging, and in excess it hastens the aging of our bodies and minds. At the level of society, persecution and bullying, neglect and injustice, scarcity and want, all inflict both individual and collective stress. As a response to its presence, as individuals we move our bodies, amuse our minds, contain our impulses in meditation, create and enjoy music and art, arrange social engagements, and seek the sublime muse that Nature can be. We strive to redress sources of communal stress – through activism, a commitment to justice, and the lifting of noisome prejudices. We invite you to relieve yourself of weekend stress by joining inspiring researchers and seekers as they describe the problems and seek solutions to stress.",

It was held that the widowed queen of an Egyptian pharaoh could pull his posthumous sperm into her womb to create a child. The Olympian god Zeus could procreate in all sorts of ways, including swooping down as a shower of gold into a young womb. His daughter Athena sprang full-born from his head; his son Dionysus from his thigh. And it was the wind of the Holy Ghost that inseminated a certain young virgin. Inevitably, technologies entered the process of conception and pregnancy bringing with them a growing set of choices regarding gender and other attributes of offspring. The wish for greater certainty and enhanced selectivity have now entered many phases and aspects of generation. Sperm, eggs, and genes may be shared, selected, bought and sold. Polygenic screening of gene variants in embryos mandates additional consciousness, choices, and unavoidable ethical puzzles.

    "description": "The Dismal Science seems to analyze and involve most aspects of our lives.  While traditional macroeconomics continues to concern itself with  natural rates of inflation and unemployment, with tariffs and taxes, with supply and demand, at both the meso- and micro-levels, economics has productively linked with sociology, social history, anthropology, and psychology. The field of behavioral economics , having adopted the methodology of experimental psychology, is now a full-fledged subgenre within the field. Many of its fascinating and useful insights have in turn seeded new lines of investigation in these sister disciplines. Now, less out of sheer academic exuberance and more by brute necessity, economics is applying its methods to recent natural and man-made disasters of global consequence. The triad of climate change, the mass migration of refugees, and the pandemic-driven disruptions of the supply chain has descended  with alarming impact. In response, economics examines the movement of peoples and things amidst these disruptive forces, assaying their ramifications from both a birds eye view and up close. The effects on inflation, unemployment, family structure, healthcare, education, poverty and productivity are varied and profound. Our roundtable will look at the current dynamics of economics , and ask where the field may move in the 21stcentury.

    "description": "Neuroplasticity: it’s what our brains do. We alter our minds when we engage with the world and with the people in it. But, of course, when we think of “mind altering drugs” we refer to something else. That there might be a shortcut, a wormhole, a portal to some new and improved state of mind has long held our fascination. Yes, that includes alcohol, but while alcohol can affect mood and anxiety and augment sociability, there is something especially appealing about opening a window onto a whole new view of reality itself. Hence the new question born in the 1960’s: “are you experienced?’. Psychedelics have been featured and feared, romanticized and reviled, lauded and suspected since the earliest epochs of human history. In many tribal ceremonies certain substances with “mind expanding” properties were invoked as communal invitations toward the transcendent. In battle, various plants, herbs, and potions were reputed to make warriors assassins, berserkers, or heroes. From Greek roots meaning “mind manifesting,” psychedelic refers to a range of mind, mood, and consciousness altering effects – cognitive, perceptual, emotional, and behavioral – deriving from a varied array of compounds. Following the 60’s “turn on, tune in, drop out” popularity of recreational psychedelics, by the early 1970’s it was the risks associated with psychedelics that gained a hold on popular opinion and on the research community. Times are a changing. With renewed interest, medical research is now exploring psychedelics for the treatment of mental illness, pain management and mental soothing in terminal states. With care given to providing a safe physical space and emotional support throughout, psychedelics can create feelings of union and of breaking free from time and space, often accompanied by visual hallucinations, illusions, and synesthesia. But, in “micro-doses,” doses too low to bring on a “trip,” hallucinogens are now being studied and in some instances found to ameliorate the suffering of PTSD patients, to treat obsessive-compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia nervosa, headache, and substance abuse. Medical alchemists believed their mixtures could act as poison or panacea. From communal traditions and now clinical research, hope is emerging that there is something in psychedelics that can help to sooth suffering souls and provide safe and effective treatment of some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "description": "Physics being the study of the fundamental properties of Nature, as the name implies, metaphysics investigates the nature of Nature, the what-must-therefore-be-the-case of those discoverable physical properties. For centuries, either explicitly or implicitly, metaphysics created the background and organizing principles for scientific research. But as the 20th century progressed there arose a number of challenges to this position. The epistemic turn laid down by the quantum theory’s Copenhagen interpretation places our knowledge about Nature, in the sense of what we can know about it, above what it is “in itself.” Nearly contemporaneously, the famous “linguistic turn” heralded by the works of Wittgenstein and the ordinary language philosophers, urged “remaining quiet” about Nature beyond the acknowledged limits of what can be said about it. And more recently, on the heels of what has been referred to as the cognitive turn in psychology, philosophers like Richard Rorty focus on the modes of cognition and what to make of them (pragmatism redux) while the notion of Nature in itself is let go of. Today, in response to these skeptical trends, we see a revival of metaphysics, only now with a refined appreciation of how our empirical access to it relates to how Nature presents itself. The notion of an “experimental metaphysics” is no longer considered oxymoronic: some empirical research in quantum physics now offers up evidence in favor of one metaphysical view over another. Meanwhile, within perceptual neuroscience, the analysis of ambiguous stimuli is beginning to inform notions of what consciousness qua natural phenomenon could mean for the nature of Nature itself. This roundtable will scrutinize the ways in which we engage with Nature, and how the divergence of perspectives that result, some apparently strongly paradoxical, may yet be reconciled by a metaphysics that is always seeking to rise to this challenge.",

    "time": "",
    "description": "From the level of DNA to that of phenotype, life may be viewed as an articulation of code. Within such a model, phenotypes are a kind of abstraction of the DNA code. Starting with the genome, the DNA winds its way through RNA, proteins, and cellular process outward into the world beyond, and in the process it expresses an abstracted projection of itself onto the “plane” of the phenotype situated in its niche. There is one phenotype, our own, that has evolved to where it can design its own generative code. Among the many codes creating our human world is the digital, the binary lingua franca of software engineers. Written at one level as a linear script of ones and zeroes, and then expressed as other media and phenomena, coding underwrites the videos we engage with, the online menus from which we order, the diagnoses radiologists make, the security we crave, and the bombs we drop. Code serves to translate phenomena into a language distinct from the phenomena themselves: atoms, proteins, facial expressions, and the songs we love become symbols, numbers, or other grammars. This conversion is useful; it provides a way to communicate, utilize, predict, understand, and simulate phenomena. Scientific progress is impossible without a positivist kind of code, whereby a model of the world is generated through encoding phenomena into facts, mechanisms, systems, and laws that cohere logically. How do we understand an atom, for example without the scientific language encoding it? The language of the Anthropocene is code. It is coding that mints and maintains cryptocurrency and it is the language of the lightspeed communication driving financial transactions occurring every millisecond of every day. We speak to one another through encoded devices; we learn and work through screens that reconstitute our bodies and voices through the transmission of code. We play video games that are sophisticated assemblages of code, and we interact with folks online using coded exchanges. An entire meta-world is being constructed from code alone. As code comes to mediate so much of our lived experience, we face some important questions: how is our immersion in the encoded world affecting our lives? Might something vital, something unencoded or unencodable, get lost in translation? Like all abstractions, code will leave information out. Even the most sophisticated bit of code is invariably inadequate to capture the rich complexity of embodied, unmediated engagement. And what are we to make of miscommunication, misinformation, and deception by design? Code, after all, is also the language of espionage, deception, and surveillance. This conference intends to examine the various ways the digitalization of life and the growing metaverse may be separating us from an original, direct, and less abstracted form of life. What might the benefits be? And what are the costs and dangers? +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Saturday 10/15: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Sunday 10/16:",

Several laboratories worldwide have adopted his framework and provided supporting evidence for the two-stage model of memory in both experimental animals and human subjects. Over the years, the ‘ripple’ pattern has become a quantifiable biomarker of cognition. Relevant to clinical translation, hippocampal ripples, along with other brain rhythms that his laboratory has identified, lend themselves to diagnosis of disease and drug discovery.

      "description_9": "Christopher Fuchs is a Professor of Physics at the University of Massachusetts Boston who specializes in quantum information theory and quantum foundations. He is an author or co-author of over 160 scholarly pieces, one of which, “Unconditional Quantum Teleportation” with H. J. Kimble’s experimental group, was voted a “Top-Ten Breakthrough of 1998” by the editors of Science. He is a winner of the International Quantum Communication Award and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He is most widely known for the development of the quantum interpretation known as QBism, where quantum theory is seen not as a direct representation of “what is” in the universe, but rather as an aid to decision making in a universe where nature’s events have a kind of ultimate autonomy or creativity: “Nature and its parts do what they want, and we as free-willed agents do what we can get away with.” Aside from physics, Prof. Fuchs’s devotion to writing and recording historical anecdotes can be seen in his Cambridge University Press book Coming of Age with Quantum Information and still more forcefully in his 2,349 page samizdat My Struggles with the Block Universe, arXiv:1405.2390 [quant-ph].",

His work changed how we think about information encoding in the healthy and diseased brain, such as epilepsy and psychiatric diseases. His most influential work is known as the two-stage model of memory trace consolidation, with hippocampal sharp wave ripples serving as a transfer mechanism from hippocampus to neocortex. Several laboratories worldwide have adopted his framework and provided supporting evidence for the two-stage model of memory in both experimental animals and human subjects. Over the years, the ‘ripple’ pattern has become a quantifiable biomarker of cognition. Relevant to clinical translation, hippocampal ripples, along with other brain rhythms that his laboratory has identified, lend themselves to diagnosis of disease and drug discovery.

    "description": "Daily headlines have been startling and scary: “U.S. Life Expectancy Plunged in 2020, Especially for Black and Hispanic Americans,” reportedThe New York Times.“The Pandemic has Made Homelessness More Visible in Many American Cities,” notedThe Economist, whileThe Guardianannounced “The Latest UN Report is Clear: Climate Change is Here, It’s a Crisis, and It’s Caused by Fossil Fuels.” The pandemic, racist aggression, mass shootings in public schools, domestic politics turned violent, and the war in Ukraine have all contributed to this dispiriting and disorienting era in our personal and collective lives. Meanwhile, half of the population seems to feel the other half is deluded. And while  many had hoped the challenge of the pandemic would unite us, three years later the cumulative cause for alarm seems to be growing. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently suggested “The world is too scary. Politics is too creepy,” and “horror is too real,” while David Brooks wrote of “The rising tide of global sadness.” Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter surely engenders further unease about how an unelected few can control how we live and what we may know. This Roundtable discussion will consider how those in science, politics, the arts, and everyday life can rally individually and together, to meet the existential challenges and concerns of our epoch.",

    "description": "A new movement within Cognitive Psychology, known as 4E Cognition, views thought and behavior as embodied, embedded, enactive & extended. Each of these four strands has a rich (and ongoing) philosophical history. Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Bahktin, Vygotsky and others have drawn attention to the role of action and interaction in (in)forming our experience.  What do our bodies contribute to qualia, to the phenomenology that seems to mark consciousness for us? How does our embeddedness in a social world with others impact our sense of reality? And what role is played by our constant manipulation of things and interaction with others in anchoring us, not simply the way gravity keeps our feet on the ground, but as a woven fabric creates a world we can inhabit and experience together? Psychosis provides a test case for theories proposed by advocates of 4E Cognition. But, of course, it does as well for other neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers and AI researchers. How is that sense of a shared world disrupted in individuals diagnosed with this condition? How disrupted must it be and in what ways, for a diagnosis to be apposite? Meanwhile, how “shared” is the world, and what does a more or less shared world mean for the ideas, and their expression, that may be found in it? These questions and the many intriguing themes they touch on will be explored in this roundtable.",

How do individual memories differ from collective ones? What happens to our sense of belonging and selfhood when our memories are externalized in digital devices? Throughout the history of philosophy and increasingly in neurological studies, these questions have been central to our understanding of human experience. This panel seeks to address these questions by thinking of memory as a process that occurs both in and outside the brain – in which tools and infrastructures, along with social and personal experiences create the conditions for what we believe we remember. It is this extended sense of mnemonic experience that allows us to look back and think ahead. This panel will also discuss how our increasing engagement with moderntechnē(which originally meant both art and technology) can help to define, clarify, and enhance our memories, even as the digital world threatens to overwhelm our attention and corporations offer to index our every memory.

    "description": "Astrobiology is the study of life on the universe. It uses an understanding of the nature and history of life on this planet to frame expectations for biology beyond Earth. Starting in 1995, astronomers have discovered exoplanets: planets orbiting other stars. Over 5300 have been confirmed, and it’s likely there are more planets than stars in the universe. There are ten billion habitable worlds in our galaxy, all of which have the raw material for biology. The stage is set for the first detection of life beyond Earth. It might come within the Solar System, but the suitable space missions are technically challenging, expensive, and take more than a decade to plan and deliver to their destinations. It’s more likely that microbial life will be detected by its alteration of an exoplanet atmosphere. The James Webb Space Telescope and several upcoming telescopes in space and on the ground can make this type of observation. It’s also possible that more advanced forms of intelligent life will be found through evidence of their technology. A panel of expert astrobiologists will discuss various strategies for detecting life beyond Earth, and debate which is most likely to succeed and when. Proof that biology is not unique to this planet would be one of the most profound events in the history of science.",

Shakespeare’s works remain as compelling as ever, and they are being envisioned in both traditional and often astonishingly new ways. In Boston, Chicago, Idaho, Kentucky, Lake Tahoe, Oregon, New York City and beyond, regional companies are gearing up for their annual sell-out summer Shakespeare festivals. The books and articles keep coming, and there is no end, it seems, to the new and different ways in which the Bard can be perceived: “All of Shakespeare’s Plays Are About Race,” declared a recent article inThe Atlantic.

And across the millennia emotion has forever been at the heart of most matters. Human history has been shaped by emotion and reshaped by attitudes toward emotion; a powerful human force philosophers and theologians confront and reckon with again and again throughout history and in every culture. So near and so familiar to us all and yet emotions present all sorts of philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific paradoxes. Many of the same mysteries elicited by the study of consciousness generally seem to re-emerge even after zooming our focus in on emotion. Are the neural signatures of an emotion the same as the experience of that emotion? Do feelings contribute to our evolutionary fitness or are they by-products, epiphenomena that somehow follow from some more fundamental form of adaptation? How can we ever know what it’s like tofeellike a bat? Is that rat laughing at me? Why do emotions seem to control us at times, control our thoughts and behavior, while at other times we apparently have control over them? Listening to music, sipping some tea, calling a close friend: all of these activities are a means to sculpt our state of mind. When do they work and why do they sometimes fail so miserably? Do the emotions form a natural class? Cellos and oboes are both classified as instruments despite their obvious differences, and yet consider this: each can play the same melody. What features and what functions do the emotions share in common? This question is raised now especially as there is talk of incorporating empathy into artificial intelligence programming. Can sadness, anger, frustration, jealousy and joy be programmed? Should they be? Are they simply different component modules of general intelligence or do the emotions grow organically out of some other feature of experience that we don’t yet understand?",

Impermanence of mathematical concepts is the rule rather than the exception.  The progress of mathematics is punctuated by revolutions, in ways similar to the evolution of  art and science  Fundamental notions can change even in the space of a single generation, and disarray and controversy may follow.  Given that something so basic as the number 5 is subject to such instability, how can we still claim that mathematics is about absolute truth?  We will discuss various revolutions in mathematical concepts, from non-Euclidean geometry to imaginary numbers to some more intuition-defying contemporary developments.",

    "description": "What are the effects of media today? What exactly is “social” about social media? How do media shape reality? Are developments in AI changing media as we understand communications technologies? Sixty years ago, the Canadian Professor of English and Media, Marshall McLuhan published the unexpectedly popular volume Understanding Media (1964), which would go on to establish a vocabulary addressing these questions — a vocabulary and set of ideas that scholars continue to grapple with to this day. But the world of media has shifted radically since then, and with the advent of social media and artificial intelligence the idea that “the medium is the message” has taken on a kind of new urgency. This panel will address these questions, as well as those that deal with how we will define and experience media in the future.",

He is the author most recently of New York Exposed: The Gilded Age Police Scandal That Launched the Progressive Era (Oxford, 2016; pb, 2018). Mike Wallace, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History for Gotham described the book as “a walk on the seamy side of Gotham in the 1890s, peopled with brutal cops, corrupt politicians, conniving businessmen, evangelical zealots, exploited immigrants, earnest reformers, and sensational media…A tour-de-force of investigation and interpretation.” Novelist Kevin Baker said of New York Exposed, “Careful and rigorous history, it nonetheless reads like a gripping police procedural filled with some of the most colorful and outrageous characters of our past.” Czitrom’s previous book, Rediscovering Jacob Riis: Exposure Journalism and Photography in Turn of the Century New York (with Bonnie Yochelson, New Press, 2008; University of Chicago Press pb., 2014) offered a fresh look at the Progressive era social reformer, journalist, and pioneer photographer who publicized the conditions of the desperately poor in New York. The book received wide attention, including reviews n the NY Times, LA Times, and Chicago Tribune, and it was the subject of a special feature by Robert Siegel on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered (June 30, 2008). Sam Roberts in the NY Times praised the book as, “an evocative reminder both of one unrelenting individual’s ability to make a difference and the relevance of his revelations to the painfully familiar problems we face today.” Czitrom is also the author of Media and the American Mind: From Morse to McLuhan (University of North Carolina Press, 1982; pb 1984 and still in print), which received the First Books Award from the American Historical Association and has been translated into Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. He is co-author of Out of Many: A History of the American People (Pearson, 9th ed., 2020), a best-selling US History college textbook. Czitrom has been deeply engaged with bringing history to wider audiences beyond the academy. From 2011-13 he served as the historical advisor for Copper, an original dramatic television series set in Civil War-era New York and broadcast over BBC America. He has appeared as a featured on-camera commentator for numerous documentary film projects, most recently in Walter Winchell: The Power of Gossip (PBS/American Masters, 2020). Previous appearances include New York: A Documentary Film (PBS, 1999); American Photography: A Century of Images (PBS, 1999); The Great Transatlantic Cable (PBS/American Experience, 2005); The Rise and Fall of Penn Station (PBS/American Experience, 2014); and Joseph Pulitzer: Voice of the People (PBS/American Masters, 2019.

    "date": "March 9th, 2024 at 2:30PM",
    "time": "",
    "description": "“Now the touch only is common to all animals.”  Agrippa The very notion of sentience, with its root infeeling, cannot be understood without some reference to sensation. And sensation itself has at its bare core a “something” we feel. The response to that feeling is the mark of life: “quickening” upon touch is how we distinguish the animate from the inanimate. Touch demands physical contact. That breeze is the invisible dance of molecules on your face. Warmth is the agitation of your own particulate self, while coolness is the dissipation of that same agitation into the surround. While the scientific termmechanicalrefers to a physical force that contacts and thereby moves things, in the case of organisms, mechanical force incites a sensation on contact with that boundary, the skin. And whereas otherwise we say every action has an equal and opposite reaction, at that interface with the living some neuro-electrochemical reaction occurs. We understand that this new electrochemical medium somehow accounts for our inner feeling and that outer feeling of presence. The movement from sensation to perception is where talk of consciousness begins: where sensations “touch” our inner selves and form an experience we can engage and report on. This is our qualia. Citing Duchamp’s concept of theinfra-thin,Marjorie Perloff depicts that interface where sensation arises. The infra-thin partakes both sides of that interface and the interface along with it: this is the space toward which poetry directs us.",

He proposes a revision of the prevailing interpretation of the history of modal logic according to which Scotus rejected the principle of plenitude attributed to Aristotle and replaced the ancient diachronic theory of possibilities with a synchronic one, thereby contributing to a “possible world’s semantics.” Rather, Massie argues that in its proper ontological import, the question of possibility concerns the limit between being and non-being and that this limit must be thought in terms of temporality. He also wrote articles on Aristotle, Achard of Saint Victor, Duns Scotus, and Heidegger.

From a bag of Cheetos to Michelin 3-star fare we cover a lot of ground, yet financial means alone fails to account fully for the popularity of both ends of this culinary spectrum. Whatdoesaccount for taste? And from there: what role does discernment play in judgment? Beyond touch, the interface here – our tongue – dense in receptor sites, transcribes chemical as well as mechanical signals into electrochemical reactions. The feel of food and the flavor of food combine to form the sense of taste. And while taste may have evolved as a means to solve the problem of hunger, taste clearly is no longer limited to its role in satiety. This dissociation of hunger and taste presents itself both as a problem (formerlygluttony) and as a refined pleasure that forms its own category of art. Con gusto!Historically, how did we move from the pleasure or disgust that food brings to that sense of taste suggesting discernment? And taste as a personal quality –is it innate or acquired– has engaged the field of aesthetics and practical reason since classical times.",

    "description": "As the first sense to engage the world “remotely”, beyond the boundary of an organism’s body, olfaction delivers news from “over there”. But whereas it adumbrates a space beyond, what kind of space, what sort of world does it proffer? Smell engages the world as a series of pathways laid out on gradients. What is that wonderful aroma and how can I get to it?  Eww! What is that and how do I move away? More a path-wise world than a Newtonian one, the space of olfaction is about orienting the animal toward what is meaningful in its environment. Smell creates an ambiance, an affective and drive-related milieu, and it also strongly evokes memories of such settings. We have learned that body odor elicit feelings of personal attraction and repulsion. And yet, many of these interactions between the olfactory surround and our motivations, our inclinations, our personal history, carry on below the surface of consciousness. As this ubiquitous but often subtle background to our lives, scent has played a prominent role in cultural history.",

Refinements of this sense, and in some animals theemissionof vibration – typically from the vocal cords – has evolved to echolocation, to clicks, grunts, roars and to speech. The vibration of one special membrane, the ear drum, creates that wonderful interface that enables us to appreciate and locate sounds in 3-dimensional space and to discern what the source of that sound is. Through that tiny interface a realm both wide and deep opens up. Through naturally occurring sounds, but especially through music, our emotions can be strongly influenced and even molded. Leonard Bernstein described music as a sonic sculpture whose parade-like evanescence incorporates rhythm, intensity, tone, and coloration. Time and timing enter into this experience, and that fourth dimension moves us closer to Newtonian space, as a sense of depth and of movement emerge and are refined.

    "description": "“The Aleph was probably two to three centimeters in diameter, but universal space was contained inside it . . .”  – JL Borges Our eyes move. They rove and they direct attention. Indeed, vision and our ability to focus attention more generally are intimately intertwined. And this hybrid faculty of vision/attention has been extended as a metaphor for the way we focus our attention to the contents of our minds, even when vision is not active. Of course, for many animals vision is not the most important sense. And this simple fact raises so many interesting puzzles concerning animal consciousness and the senses in general. How is our apperception of a world related to the senses through which we perceive it? How different is experience for those of us without vision, either inborn or lost? How might attention “work” differently when the other senses must take the lead? For most of us visionsynthesizesthe four other senses and provides the glue that vouches for our assertions of truth and claims of falsehood. What makes“the fox jumped over the fence”true, or false, for us?Eyewitnessandcertaintyare two concepts so closely related. Vision naturally figures in the creation and recording of images, and then too, of written language and its development.

    "description": "Panpsychism is the lightly subscribed philosophical position that consciousness is a property of all matter, large and small, simple and complex, alive and inert. According to panpsychism mind is everywhere. Eliminativism is the view that consciousness, at least what most of us consider our mind’s eye access to reality(phenomenal consciousness), exists quite literally nowhere, not even in our brains. According to this view, consciousness and its associated qualia are illusions. Between panpsychism and eliminativism there are quite a few alternative accounts of what consciousness is, but most adhere to the notion that it is demonstrably localizable and that its location is in the brain. The brain receives information inbound from Nature, which it represents and then responds to by predicting, constantly updating and predicting, how things in the world go. This general approach to consciousness is currently how most investigators in the field of consciousness studies are oriented, with several competing theories all falling within this framework. A relatively recent addition to this collection of metaphysical/scientific positions is the view that our minds grow and exist as a dynamic amalgam of the world, our bodies, and our brains; that it extends from our bodies out into the world; that our perceptions of an “out there” do not simplyrepresentthat space but are in fact, in part,out therein space. This approach has evolved into what is now known as 4E Cognition. The four E’s stand forextended,embedded,embodied, andenacted. While pulling up short of panpsychism, it pushes out and away from the purely brain-centered view of consciousness. This Roundtable intends to look into the debate about the where and wherefore of consciousness, with Eliminativism and 4E Cognition taken up: two fascinating and counterintuitive attempts to provide answers.",

What do we talk about when we talk about Otherness? When did the concept first appear in Western discourse?  How did “Othering” become a verb? Why is xenophobia surging across the Western world again? For phenomenologists—and infancy researchers–the awareness ofother mindsis thought to be a normative, even constitutive aspect of our very capacity for what Husserl termed, “transcendental subjectivity”: Infants become aware that objects and persons in the world arereallythere because of an implicit sense that they are available—or could be–to other experiencing subjects in a shared social world. And yet the capacity to maintain the sense of the other as a like-minded subject becomes a never-ending struggle—both in early infancy, and, as Hegel intimated, in the broad historical sense: We seem to live with the perennial possibility of either erasing the Other as subject—or being erased by the Other in turn. Can attending to the developmental and historical roots of Otherness help us understand—and even transcend the sort of Master-Slave dilemma that has so marked our current political moment—where, as the psychoanalyst/social theorist Jessica Benjamin puts it, “only one can live”?",
